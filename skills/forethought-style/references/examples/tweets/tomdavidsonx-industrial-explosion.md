**1/7:** To quickly transform the world, it's not enough for AI to become super smart (the "intelligence explosion")

AI will also have to turbocharge the physical world (the "industrial explosion")

New post lays out the stages of the industrial explosion, and argues it will be fast! 🧵

**2/7:** Stage 1: AI-directed human labour

AI automates cognitive work, and humans shift to manual labour. AIs instruct them through headphones. Their phones livestream their surroundings to AIs.

This could raise physical output by 10X within a few years. That's already transformative!

**3/7:** Stage 2: robots replace human labour

Think robot factories making more+better robot factories…

With roughly today's physical technology (but abundant AI cognitive labour), robots could self-replicate every ~year. (Big error bars!)

1-year doubling times is fast!

**4/7:** Stage 3: nanotech

Smaller robots could self-replicate more quickly.

Based on biological analogies and extrapolating robot experience curves, we think robots might eventually self-replicate in a week or less.

One-week nanobot doubling times would be extremely fast!

**6/7:** This fleshes out earlier work by @willmacaskill and @finmoorhouse on how an intelligence explosion could drive explosive technological progress

**7/7:** Also see the analysis of the dynamics of the *intelligence* explosion by myself and @daniel_271828
