**1/13:** How easy is it to get to a future that's pretty close to ideal?

In "No Easy Eutopia", @finmoorhouse and I argue that it's very hard - very unlikely to happen by default, without some beings in the future trying hard to figure out what "goodness" consists in, and actively trying to promote it.

**2/13:** You could think of reaching eutopia as like an expedition to sail to an uninhabited island. The expedition is more likely to reach the island to the extent that:

**3/13:** 1. The island is bigger, more visible, and closer to the point of departure;
2. The ship's navigation systems work well, and are aimed toward the island;

**4/13:** 3. The ship's crew can send out smaller reconnaissance boats, and not everyone onboard the ship needs to reach the island for the expedition to succeed.

**5/13:** Similarly, we could be on track for a near-best future for a few different reasons.

**6/13:** First, eutopian futures could present a big target: that is, society would end up reaching a near-best outcome across a wide variety of possible futures, even without deliberately honing in on a very specific conception of an extremely good future.

**7/13:** We call this the "easy eutopia" view.

**8/13:** Second, even if the target is narrow, society might nonetheless *hone in* on that target — maybe because society as a whole accurately converges onto the right moral view and is motivated to act on it,

**9/13:** or because some people have the right view and compromise between them and the rest of society gets us the rest of the way.

**10/13:** This article focuses on the first of these. (The next essay, Convergence and Compromise, will focus on the next two.)

**11/13:** There are many ways in which future society could miss out on most value, or even end up dystopian - many of which are quite subtle. The "target" of a near-best future is very narrow.

**12/13:** We give two main arguments, which I'll present in separate twitter threads.
