**1/6:** How bad would it be if someone tried to create as much space debris as possible? 🧵

**2/6:** More debris means more collisions with satellites and other debris fragments… creating even more of it. If that process blows up, it's called Kessler syndrome.

**3/6:** Assuming we get our act together on cleanup and tracking, and we don't see many more kinetic anti-sat weapons, I think it's fairly unlikely we'll sleepwalk into Kessler syndrome so bad that it becomes impractical to put sats in preferential orbits.

**4/6:** But what if someone launched debris *into* orbit from Earth? That could make things a lot worse.

In the extreme, huge amounts of debris could even block launches *passing through* orbit. Fortunately I think that's quite unlikely to be practical, especially with better shielding.

**5/6:** Still, other kinds of 'launch denial' could become important to understand.

Antics like this in space could soon become both much cheaper to carry out, and more destabilising. There are some basic mitigations we can get on top of, especially better tracking launch payloads.
