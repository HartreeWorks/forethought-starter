**1/11:** Could one country (or company!) outgrow the rest of the world during an AI-powered growth explosion?

Many stories of world domination involve military conquest. But perhaps a country could become dominant without any aggression?

New post explores whether this could happen. 🧵

**2/11:** Background assumptions:

Once AI surpasses humans at all tasks:
1. Intelligence explosion: AI builds smarter AI, which builds...
2. Industrial explosion: robots quickly build more+better robots, which build…
3. Tech explosion: AIs + robots build ever better tech

**3/11:** During this growth explosion, could one country outgrow the world and end up with >99% of world GDP?

I discuss two ways that could happen:
1. Grabbing resources in space
2. Staying ahead of everyone else on a super-exponential growth trajectory

**4/11:** #1: Grabbing space resources

Less than 1 billionth of the sun's energy hits earth. Today, we can't harness all that extra energy.

But superhuman AI will develop new tech that makes this possible.

If a country grabs space resources, they'll dominate economically.

**5/11:** Key uncertainty: does settling space have a "winner takes all" dynamic?

If not, grabbing space resources won't allow a country to *increase* its dominance (e.g. go from 60% of world GDP to >99%).

**6/11:** #2 Staying ahead of everyone else on a super-exponential growth trajectory

Recently, economic growth has been exponential.

If I'm 20 years ahead of you on an exponential growth trajectory, we both grow at the same rate.

My economic lead remains constant.

**7/11:** But growth models predict that, after superhuman AI, growth will be super-exponential.

Growth gets faster and faster over time.

If I'm 20 years ahead of you on a super-exponential growth trajectory, I grow faster than you.

My economic lead increases until I completely dominate

**8/11:** A country can only outgrow the world this way if:

i) it has >50% of world GDP
ii) growth eventually becomes so fast that the economy doubles every ~year

I defend these assumptions.

And even if (i) is false, a coalition of countries with >50% GDP could still outgrow the world

**9/11:** Key uncertainty: can lagging countries keep up by copying technologies developed by the leader?

This is how China/Japan/Korea grew so fast after WW2

To prevent this, I think the leading country/coalition would need to massively restrict trade and reduce its own short-term GDP.

**10/11:** Overall, I'd guess that the country that first develops superhuman AI could outgrow the rest of the world if it tried hard to restrict trade

Whether it's will try this is less clear. I'd bet against.

This is all exploratory early-stage thinking - not to be trusted!
