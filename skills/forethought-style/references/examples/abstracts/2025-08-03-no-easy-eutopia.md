# No Easy Eutopia: Why Great Futures Are Hard to Achieve

The essay examines whether achieving a mostly-great future is difficult or easy. The authors argue that "only a narrow range of futures meet this bar" and that even seemingly excellent societies risk falling significantly short of their potential. They contend that the value of the future depends on getting many contingent factors right simultaneously—from population ethics to digital being welfare—such that a single moral error could undermine most achievable value. Through systematic analysis of different moral frameworks, they conclude that most plausible views are "fussy" about what constitutes a near-best future, requiring society to hit a narrow target rather than naturally drifting toward utopia through material abundance alone.
