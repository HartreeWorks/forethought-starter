# How to Make the Future Better: Concrete Actions for Flourishing

This research paper explores concrete actions humanity can take to improve long-term futures beyond mere survival. MacAskill proposes strategies across two primary approaches: keeping civilization's options open and actively steering toward better outcomes.

The essay outlines methods to preserve flexibility during critical transitions, including preventing post-AGI autocracy, delaying space resource allocation decisions, implementing sunset clauses on major laws, and potentially slowing intelligence explosions. It then discusses steering mechanisms such as improving superintelligence governance structures, advancing value-alignment in AI systems beyond control measures, establishing frameworks for digital entity rights, refining collective decision-making processes, and mitigating sub-extinction catastrophes.

The work emphasizes that "small tweaks to new laws or treaties might become very important at later times," particularly regarding space governance and AI development frameworks. MacAskill presents both theoretical research needs—examining lock-in mechanisms and envisioning desirable futures—and applied research priorities addressing power concentration, persuasion technologies, and global governance systems.
