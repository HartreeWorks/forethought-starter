# Better Futures: Making Good Futures Even Better

The series examines how to improve humanity's future beyond merely avoiding catastrophe. MacAskill explains: "Suppose we want the future to go better. What should we do?" Rather than focusing solely on existential risks, the work explores "improving on futures where we survive, to achieve a truly great future."

The collection comprises five main essays plus a supplementary piece, structured sequentially beginning with "Introducing Better Futures." Topics include the narrowness of near-optimal futures, whether society naturally converges toward them, whether improvements persist over long timescales, and concrete actions for positive change. The final supplement applies prioritization frameworks to compare catastrophe prevention with improving flourishing quality.
