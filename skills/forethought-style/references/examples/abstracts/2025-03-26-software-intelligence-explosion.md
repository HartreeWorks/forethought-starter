# Will AI R&D Automation Cause a Software Intelligence Explosion?

AI companies increasingly employ AI systems to accelerate research and development. Future systems might autonomously manage the entire AI development cycle. The report examines whether such systems—called ASARA (AI Systems for AI R&D Automation)—would trigger accelerating feedback loops resulting in dramatically faster AI progress through software improvements alone, termed a "software intelligence explosion" (SIE).

The analysis employs an economic model assessing two competing forces: positive feedback from increasingly capable AI systems performing R&D, and diminishing returns from exhausting easier improvements. Drawing on empirical data regarding recent software progress rates and expanding research efforts, the authors find that "AI software is improving at a rate that likely outpaces the growth rate of research effort needed" to achieve these advances. This suggests the feedback loop could overcome diminishing returns, enabling an SIE.

The report identifies two major obstacles—fixed computing constraints and lengthy training times—but concludes plausible workarounds exist. The authors recommend proactive governance measures including monitoring software progress, pre-deployment assessments of AI R&D capabilities, and threshold-based safeguards before deploying systems capable of substantially accelerating AI development.
