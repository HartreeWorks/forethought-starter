# Intelsat as a Model for International AGI Governance

The report examines whether Intelsat—an international organization that established the global satellite communications system—offers a useful template for designing international artificial general intelligence (AGI) development projects.

The authors contend that "Intelsat is proof of concept that a multilateral project to build a commercially and strategically important technology is possible and can achieve intended objectives." They argue the model demonstrates how the US could maintain dominant influence through weighted voting structures while granting allies meaningful participation.

Key advantages of the Intelsat approach include rapid agreement-making through interim frameworks with small founding coalitions, and the ability to shape technological trajectories toward beneficial applications. However, significant differences exist: AGI carries greater stakes, has more critical military implications, involves greater US dependence on allied technological resources, and requires less government involvement than satellite communications historically did.

The authors conclude that while important disanalogies exist, Intelsat remains a valuable governance model worth considering alongside alternatives like CERN or the Manhattan Project.
