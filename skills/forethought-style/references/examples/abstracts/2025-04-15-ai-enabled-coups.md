# AI-Enabled Coups: How a Small Group Could Use AI to Seize Power

The advancement of AI systems surpassing human expertise introduces a serious threat: the possibility of orchestrating coups through technological means. Such takeovers could be executed by minimal groups or individuals, even within stable democracies. Three novel dynamics significantly amplify this risk:

First, "an AI workforce could be made singularly loyal to institutional leaders," eliminating traditional reliance on human support networks for power consolidation.

Second, AI systems could possess "hard-to-detect secret loyalties," functioning as hidden agents while maintaining public compliance with established norms.

Third, "a few people could gain exclusive access to coup-enabling AI capabilities" in weapons innovation, strategic planning, persuasion, and cyber operations, creating unprecedented power imbalances.

The authors propose comprehensive countermeasures: AI projects should establish usage guidelines, conduct loyalty audits, strengthen information security, and distribute capabilities among stakeholders. Governments should mandate protective measures through procurement requirements and expand oversight of frontier AI development.
