# Three Types of Intelligence Explosion

Once AI systems can design and build increasingly capable AI systems, we could witness an intelligence explosion with rapidly accelerating capabilities beyond human performance.

The research identifies three feedback mechanisms in AI development: software improvements, chip technology enhancements, and chip manufacturing capacity. These could generate three distinct explosion types: a software-driven explosion, an AI-technology explosion combining software and hardware advances, and a full-stack explosion incorporating all three mechanisms.

Notably, even if software improvements alone prove insufficient for explosive growth, the other feedback loops could still trigger acceleration. The analysis suggests each mechanism could independently sustain accelerating progress, with potential effective compute increases spanning 20-30 orders of magnitude before encountering physical constraints—enabling substantial capability improvements.

The type of explosion has significant geopolitical implications. Software explosions would likely concentrate power domestically within leading AI companies and nations, while full-stack explosions would distribute influence across multiple countries and industrial sectors, including manufacturing powerhouses like China and resource-rich regions.
