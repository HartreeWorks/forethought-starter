# Could One Country Outgrow the Rest of the World After AGI?

When economies grow exponentially, relative sizes between nations remain constant. However, after AGI development, economic growth may become superexponential—accelerating continuously over time. Under such conditions, "an initial economic lead becomes bigger and bigger over time. The leader eventually produces >99% of global output."

The analysis identifies two primary pathways to dominance: the Superexponential Growth Argument and the Grabbing New Resources Argument. The first requires a country or bloc controlling >50% of GDP to prevent technological diffusion among competitors. The second involves seizing unclaimed resources, particularly space-based solar energy, to convert temporary advantages into permanent dominance.

A critical constraint is technological diffusion. While the leading AI nation could theoretically outgrow the world, doing so "only if it makes a concerted and well-coordinated effort to prevent technological diffusion." Such coordination might occur through US-allied export controls on AI chips or following a coup by power-seeking actors.
