# Preparing for the Intelligence Explosion

"AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological progress over just a few years." The paper argues that rapid technological advancement will create numerous consequential challenges requiring immediate decisions. These include emerging weapons systems, AI-enabled authoritarianism, competition for space resources, and questions surrounding digital consciousness—alongside opportunities for dramatically improved living standards and governance.

The authors contend that many of these challenges cannot be delegated to future AI systems. They propose immediate preparatory measures including preventing extreme power concentration, empowering responsible actors, building decision-support tools, removing bureaucratic obstacles to AI adoption, designing governance frameworks for emerging domains, and increasing public understanding of these developments.

The paper challenges the notion that outcomes depend solely on AI alignment, arguing instead that comprehensive preparation across multiple domains is necessary to navigate an accelerated technological landscape successfully.
