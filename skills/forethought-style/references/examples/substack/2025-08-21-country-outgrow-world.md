# Could One Country Outgrow the World After AGI?

## Introduction

The central question explored is whether a single nation could achieve economic dominance through outgrowing the rest of the world after developing AGI. Davidson references Bostrom's concept of a "decisive strategic advantage"—technological superiority enabling complete global dominance—but proposes an economic rather than military pathway.

## The Superexponential Growth Argument

Under current conditions, economic growth is roughly exponential, maintaining consistent relative GDP ratios between nations. However, AGI could trigger superexponential growth, where the expansion rate itself accelerates over time. This creates a mechanism where an initial economic lead compounds increasingly rapidly.

**Key insight:** "If countries follow superexponential growth trajectories, an initial economic lead becomes bigger and bigger over time."

### Objection 1: Trade Dynamics

International trade complicates the scenario. A leading country cannot outgrow the world if it represents less than 50% of global GDP while other nations trade collectively. The US currently represents approximately 25% of world output, making this threshold difficult without substantial GDP expansion.

### Objection 2: Self-Sufficiency Requirements

No single nation produces all essential goods. Semiconductor supply chains exemplify this complexity. Complete economic decoupling would impose substantial short-term costs, though gradual decoupling might prove feasible given unprecedented growth rates.

### Objection 3: Technological Diffusion

Lagging nations historically achieve rapid "catch-up growth" by adopting existing technologies rather than discovering them independently. This disadvantages leading innovators. Preventing tech diffusion would require massive coordinated governmental effort—restricting profitable international trades to maintain relative advantages.

The author notes: "Preventing tech diffusion seems plausible but would require forcibly excluding other countries from trade, making the world poorer initially."

### Objection 4: Dangerous Precedent

If a 51-nation coalition outgrows the remaining 49%, nothing prevents 26 of them from later fragmenting to dominate the other 25. This recursive pattern might incentivize all parties to reject such strategies preemptively.

## The Grabbing New Resources Argument

Only one billionth of the sun's energy reaches Earth. Controlling solar system resources could increase available output by a factor of one billion. A technologically advanced nation might seize unclaimed cosmic resources, converting a temporary lead into permanent dominance.

Key uncertainty: whether resource-grabbing involves "winner-takes-all dynamics," allowing disproportionate control despite smaller initial GDP share.

## Company-Level Outgrowth

A single corporation could theoretically outgrow the world by: establishing a monopoly on frontier AI, acquiring over 50% of global physical capital, and developing self-replicating productive infrastructure faster than competitors could respond.

The challenge: acquiring sufficient physical capital before losing technological advantages requires physical assets to double monthly—an extremely demanding requirement.

## Conclusions

The author concludes outgrowing the world is "plausible but not certain" for leading nations, particularly if tech diffusion prevention succeeds. A US-led democratic alliance excluding authoritarian countries represents the most realistic scenario. Company-level dominance remains possible but faces steeper obstacles.
