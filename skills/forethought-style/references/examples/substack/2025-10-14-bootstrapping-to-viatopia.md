# Bootstrapping to Viatopia

## Lock-in Escape Velocity

The piece introduces the concept of "lock-in escape velocity"—the dynamic where brief periods of entrenchment can gradually extend into longer ones. MacAskill illustrates this with a hypothetical: a one-world government initially maintains power for roughly a decade, then uses that time to ensure they can remain in power for twenty additional years, and so forth.

The concerning implication is that "short-term entrenchment into indefinite lock-in" might occur before comprehensive mechanisms for perpetual control fully develop. Given that AGI could arrive within years or decades, MacAskill argues it's "currently possible to achieve lock-in escape velocity."

## Bootstrapping to Viatopia

The article's central optimistic thesis proposes reversing this dynamic. Rather than pursuing dramatic, sweeping changes immediately, society could implement modest initial interventions that create space for reflection. This reflection itself could prompt slightly longer deliberation periods, establishing a positive feedback cycle.

**Key examples include:**

- **AI Development Pause:** A leading AI nation implements a one-month pause on frontier development. By month's end, decision-makers recognize the need for extension. This modest initial pause could eventually grow into whatever duration proves necessary.

- **Constitutional Convention:** Post-AGI, a global constitutional assembly meets for one month with option to extend annually. Deliberation length adjusts to match what decision-makers determine as sufficient.

The approach works because choices are made with current context and improved AI counsel unavailable today. Importantly, bootstrapping needn't focus solely on temporal extension—it could deepen reflection quality or shift its character entirely.

MacAskill concludes: society might lack wisdom for major consequential decisions now, yet remains capable of pausing briefly or reflecting more carefully. That wiser society would likely recognize the need for deeper contemplation, eventually reaching reflection periods "as long and hard as we should."
