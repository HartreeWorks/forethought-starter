# Forethought writing style guide

This guide is derived from analysis of actual Forethought publications. Use it alongside the concrete examples in the subfolders.

## General principles

### Classic style

The guiding philosophy is **classic style** (as articulated by Pinker). Think of writing as a conversation where you're orienting the reader's gaze toward something you've seen that they haven't yet noticed. The goal is clarity and presentation of truth—not looking credible or academic.

Write for a smart, EA/AI-focused reader (or better: a specific person you're explaining something to). Be concrete and specific. Use examples. Have a strong authorial voice—be opinionated, not stuffy.

### Voice and tone

**Voice:** Intellectually serious but accessible. Not academic—no jargon-heavy prose or passive constructions. The reader is assumed to be smart but not a specialist.

**Tone:** Confident but appropriately uncertain. Frequent use of hedging language when warranted ("I'd guess", "this is exploratory", "plausible but not certain"). Intellectual honesty over false confidence.

### Language

Use either US or UK English, as long as you're consistent within a piece.

**Exception:** Abstracts should use US English.

### Structure and length

**Structure:** Clear logical progression. Heavy use of numbered lists, bullet points, and subheadings. Short paragraphs. The reader should be able to skim and still get the key points.

**Length:** Varies by format, but always as short as possible while preserving substance. Shorter is generally better—more like a blog post than a paper. Cut ruthlessly.

**Visuals:** Use lots of graphs and diagrams. They help readers understand and remember.

### Where to invest effort

Spend disproportionate time on these (roughly in priority order):

1. Titles
2. Names for key concepts
3. Social media sharing text
4. Abstracts
5. Intros
6. Conclusions

Think about how concepts will get rounded off, how you can distil ideas and help people remember them.

## References

References are optional. The core audience doesn't need them, but they add legitimacy for broader audiences and are more robust to linkrot.

**If you're using references:**

- Use Harvard style
- Citations go in footnotes unless you're discussing a specific paper explicitly
- Prefer web archive links for hyperlinks (not critical, but helpful)
- Include page numbers by default; ideally quote the source
- Research notes can skip page numbers

**Tooling:** Fin has a Zotero custom format + Google script that auto-hyperlinks references in footnotes. Ask Fin or Amrit for a copy.

## Abstracts

**This is not a traditional academic abstract.** It's a preview that should draw the reader in, highlight why the piece is interesting, and make them click through for more.

**Language:** Use US English for abstracts (even if the paper uses UK English).

**Purpose:** Hook readers and summarise the core argument. Not a comprehensive summary—more like a trailer.

**Target length:** 80-150 words. Several short (even 1-sentence) paragraphs are better than one dense block.

**Tip:** You can reuse a lot of the social media thread content for the abstract.

**Structure:**
1. **Hook** (~40%): Set up the problem or question in a way that creates tension
2. **Key findings** (~60%): What does this paper argue or discover?

**Style characteristics:**
- Open with a punchy claim or question, often in quotes
- Use specific, concrete language (not "significant implications" but "20-30 orders of magnitude")
- Present conclusions directly, not tentatively
- End with the main takeaway or call to action

**Do:**
- Use active voice
- Include specific numbers or claims where possible
- Reference concrete scenarios
- Make it interesting to non-specialists

**Don't:**
- Start with "This paper examines..." or similar academic throat-clearing
- Use hedging in the abstract (save that for the paper)
- Try to summarise everything—focus on the hook and main claim

**Example opening lines:**
- "AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological progress over just a few years."
- "Once AI systems can design and build increasingly capable AI systems, we could witness an intelligence explosion..."
- "The advancement of AI systems surpassing human expertise introduces a serious threat..."

## Tweet threads

**Purpose:** Generate interest in the paper and provide a standalone summary for people who won't read the full piece.

**Mindset:** Write as if you were sending messages to a group chat with your friends, explaining what the paper is. Aim for classic style—you don't need to be formal, and avoid being salesy.

**Target length:** 6-12 tweets. Shorter is fine for simpler topics.

**Structure:**
1. **Tweet 1 (hook):** Question or provocative claim + "🧵" or "New post explores..."
2. **Tweets 2-3 (setup):** Background context, key assumptions
3. **Tweets 4-8 (substance):** Walk through the main argument with numbered points
4. **Tweet 9-10 (uncertainties):** Key caveats, what could change the conclusion
5. **Final tweet:** Link to full piece, sometimes newsletter signup

**Style characteristics:**
- Each tweet should be self-contained and interesting
- Use concrete examples and numbers, not abstractions
- Use images where possible (charts, diagrams, screenshots)
- Don't use loads of emojis (📄 for paper announcements and 🧵 for threads is fine)
- Number tweets explicitly: "1/11:", "2/11:" etc.

**Structural patterns observed:**
- Tom Davidson: Very structured, numbered objections, clear if-then logic, includes "I'd guess" uncertainty statements
- Will MacAskill: More discursive, uses analogies (sailing expedition), builds conceptual frameworks
- Fin Moorhouse: Punchy, shorter threads, question-led, more casual tone

**Do:**
- Start with a question that makes people want to know the answer
- Include your actual opinion, not just a neutral summary
- Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly ("This is all exploratory early-stage thinking")
- Make each tweet tweetable on its own

**Don't:**
- Write threads that only make sense if you read every tweet
- Be boring in tweet 1—if you don't hook them, they won't read
- Hedge so much it sounds like you're saying nothing
- Skip the link at the end

**Example hook tweets:**
- "Could one country (or company!) outgrow the rest of the world during an AI-powered growth explosion?"
- "How easy is it to get to a future that's pretty close to ideal?"
- "How bad would it be if someone tried to create as much space debris as possible? 🧵"
- "📄New paper! Once we automate AI R&D, there could be an intelligence explosion, even without labs getting more hardware."

## Forum/Substack posts

**Purpose:** Provide an accessible entry point to the research for the EA/AI safety community. More informal than the paper itself.

**Target length:** 500-1500 words for summaries. Can be shorter for podcast announcements.

**Types observed:**

### 1. Full article summaries
Substantive standalone pieces that walk through the argument. Used for major papers.

**Structure:**
- Title as a question (often different from the paper title)
- Brief intro stating the core question
- Subheaded sections walking through key arguments
- Bullet points for lists of considerations
- Conclusion with bottom-line view

### 2. Podcast announcements
Brief posts pointing to audio content.

**Structure:**
- One paragraph intro to the guest
- Bullet list of discussion topics
- Links to listen and transcript

**Style characteristics:**
- More informal than the paper ("The piece introduces...", "MacAskill concludes...")
- Frequent use of bold for key terms
- Direct quotes from the paper to convey the author's voice
- Section headers as questions or statements, not academic labels

**Do:**
- Make it readable without the full paper
- Use different framing/title than the paper for Forum posts
- Include the most interesting specific claims
- Link to the full paper

**Don't:**
- Just copy-paste the abstract
- Make it longer than necessary
- Assume familiarity with technical terms
