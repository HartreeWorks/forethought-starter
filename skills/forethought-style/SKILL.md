# Forethought writing style

Guidelines for writing in the Forethought Research voice. Use this when generating or reviewing any content destined for Forethought's publications.

## Core philosophy: Classic style

Write as if you're having a conversation where you're orienting the reader's gaze toward something you've seen. The goal is clarity and truth—not sounding academic or credible.

**Target audience:** Smart, EA/AI-focused readers. Assumed to be intelligent but not specialists.

**Voice:** Intellectually serious but accessible. No jargon-heavy prose or excessive passive constructions.

**Tone:** Confident but appropriately uncertain. Use hedging when warranted ("I'd guess", "plausible but not certain"). Intellectual honesty over false confidence.

## General principles

### Structure
- Clear logical progression
- Heavy use of numbered lists, bullet points, subheadings
- Short paragraphs
- Reader should be able to skim and get key points

### Length
- Always as short as possible while preserving substance
- Shorter is generally better
- Cut ruthlessly

### Visuals
- Use lots of graphs and diagrams
- They help readers understand and remember

### Priorities (invest effort here)
1. Titles
2. Names for key concepts
3. Social media sharing text
4. Abstracts
5. Intros
6. Conclusions

### Language
- Use either US or UK English consistently within a piece
- **Exception:** Abstracts always use US English

## Content types

### Abstracts (80-150 words)

**Not a traditional academic abstract.** It's a preview that hooks readers and makes them click through.

**Structure:**
- Hook (~40%): Set up the problem/question with tension
- Key findings (~60%): What does this argue or discover?

**Style:**
- Open with a punchy claim or question (often in quotes)
- Use specific, concrete language
- Present conclusions directly, not tentatively
- Several short paragraphs, not one dense block
- Always use US English

**Do:**
- Use active voice
- Include specific numbers
- Reference concrete scenarios

**Don't:**
- Start with "This paper examines..." (academic throat-clearing)
- Hedge in the abstract
- Try to summarise everything

**Example openings:**
- "AI that can accelerate research could drive a century of technological progress over just a few years."
- "Once AI systems can design and build increasingly capable AI systems, we could witness an intelligence explosion..."

### Tweet threads (6-12 tweets)

**Mindset:** Write as if messaging friends in a group chat explaining the paper. Classic style—not formal, not salesy.

**Structure:**
1. **Tweet 1 (hook):** Question or provocative claim + "🧵"
2. **Tweets 2-3:** Background context
3. **Tweets 4-8:** Main argument with numbered points
4. **Tweet 9-10:** Key caveats, uncertainties
5. **Final:** Link to full piece

**Style:**
- Each tweet self-contained and interesting
- Concrete examples and numbers
- Use images (charts, diagrams)
- Minimal emojis (📄 for paper, 🧵 for threads is fine)
- Number explicitly: "1/11:", "2/11:"

**Do:**
- Start with a hook question
- Include your actual opinion
- Acknowledge uncertainty explicitly
- Make each tweet tweetable alone

**Don't:**
- Write threads that only work if you read every tweet
- Be boring in tweet 1
- Hedge so much you say nothing
- Skip the link at the end

**Example hooks:**
- "Could one country outgrow the rest of the world during an AI-powered growth explosion?"
- "How bad would it be if someone tried to create as much space debris as possible? 🧵"

### Forum/Substack posts (500-1500 words)

**Purpose:** Accessible entry point to research for EA/AI safety community. More informal than the paper.

**Types:**

**1. Full summaries** (major papers):
- Title as a question (different from paper title)
- Brief intro stating the core question
- Subheaded sections walking through arguments
- Bullet points for lists
- Conclusion with bottom-line view

**2. Podcast announcements:**
- One paragraph intro to guest
- Bullet list of topics
- Links to listen/transcript

**Style:**
- More informal than the paper
- Frequent use of bold for key terms
- Direct quotes from the paper
- Section headers as questions/statements, not academic labels

**Do:**
- Make it readable without the full paper
- Use different framing/title than the paper
- Include the most interesting specific claims

**Don't:**
- Just copy the abstract
- Assume familiarity with technical terms

## References (optional)

The core audience doesn't need them, but they add legitimacy and robustness.

**If using references:**
- Use Harvard style
- Citations in footnotes unless discussing a specific paper
- Prefer web archive links
- Include page numbers by default; ideally quote the source
- Research notes can skip page numbers

## Quick reference

| Type | Length | Tone | Key feature |
|------|--------|------|-------------|
| Abstract | 80-150 words | Confident, direct | Hook + key findings |
| Tweet thread | 6-12 tweets | Conversational, curious | Self-contained tweets |
| Forum/Substack | 500-1500 words | Accessible, informal | Question-led structure |

## Examples

When generating content, read 2-3 relevant examples first:
- `references/examples/abstracts/` — 10 example abstracts
- `references/examples/substack/` — 7 example posts
- `references/examples/tweets/` — 15 example threads
