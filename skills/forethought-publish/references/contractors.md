# Contractors

## Lorie (uploading/typesetting)

**Email**: eirol1221@gmail.com

**Role**: Uploads research pieces to website, Substack, EA Forum, and LessWrong.

**Turnaround**: 3 working days (if all materials provided upfront)

### How to engage

1. Share GDoc with eirol1221@gmail.com
2. Tag Lorie in Slack
3. Also tag Amrit and Justis as FYI
4. Use existing channel for the piece or #open-dms-support-team

### What to send for website upload

- GDoc (at least comment access)
- Abstract text
- All images as high-quality PNG files
- Confirm Paper vs Research Note
- Preview image decision
- Deadline (if any)

### What to send for Substack/Forum/LW upload

- Decisions about content/titles/links
- Custom draft GDoc (if different from website text)
- Your LessWrong login details
- PNG images

**Note**: Lorie has access to the Forethought EA Forum account, so you don't need to share Forum login.

### Special case: LW/Forum crosspost

If you specifically want the LW → Forum crosspost function (shows "Also available on [Forum/LW]" UI):
- Let Lorie know explicitly
- Share your EA Forum password
- Note: Only your account shows as coauthor (no Forethought account, no other coauthors)
- Can fix by messaging Forum team to add coauthors

Default (posting via Forethought account) is usually better.

## Justis Mills (copyediting/proofreading)

**Contact**: On Slack — tag in #open-dms-support-team or DM

**Role**: Copyediting, proofreading, and upload review. Also provides substantive feedback if engaged early.

**Turnaround**: Usually 1-3 days for non-very-long pieces

### What Justis does

- **Strict copyediting**: Typos, unclear wording
- **Substantive comments**: If engaged early, provides content feedback
- **Upload review**: Reviews Lorie's draft uploads before publication

### When to engage

**Early stage (optional, recommended for papers):**
- Can give substantive feedback on content
- Forethought staff have found his comments useful
- He enjoys this work

**Late stage (default for papers, optional for research notes):**
- Copyedit/proofread pass
- Skip if he already reviewed earlier and you haven't made deep edits

**Upload review:**
- Automatic — Lorie notifies him when uploads ready
- He reviews using the upload review checklist

### Background

Justis is an editor active specifically in AI safety, so he has context on the field and Forethought's work.

## Irina Titkova (diagrams)

**Email**: irina.titkova90@gmail.com

**Role**: Creates diagrams in Forethought style

### How to engage

2. Tell her you're from Forethought and want Forethought style
3. If first time working with her, cc Amrit

Irina knows the style rules, so just send the diagram and she'll handle formatting.
