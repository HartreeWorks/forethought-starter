# Social media & Forum accounts

## General

- **Typefully**: We post on all social media using Typefully. It lets us draft X/Bluesky/Threads/LinkedIn posts together, then press one button to post them all.

## Accounts

### Typefully

Two options for how to log in:

1. Log in using the Forethought Twitter login, which is in the team 1Password
2. Amrit can invite you to Typefully as a user. To do this, you need to have your own Twitter account.
   - This will let you use Typefully to post from your own social media accounts too.
   - It will also let you choose to share access, so others on the team can post from your accounts, if you want.
