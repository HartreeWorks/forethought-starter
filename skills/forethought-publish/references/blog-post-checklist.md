# Blog post checklist

The blog post process is designed to be completable in ~20 minutes once Max gives signoff.

## Review & signoff

### Send to Max for review & signoff
- Default step, but Max rarely leaves blocking comments
- If he doesn't explicitly say something is blocking, proceed
- Can share a Substack draft directly with Max
- If Max is away: Will, Tom, or Stefan can substitute
- **Slack:** Offer to draft and send a message to Max (show draft, confirm before sending)

### Revise based on comments
- Address comments to the extent desired
- Optional: get review from other people

## Publication prep

### Spellcheck
- At minimum, use Google Docs spellcheck

### Social media thread (optional)
- Decide whether to do a substantial Forethought social media thread
- A simple link share is always fine
- If doing a proper thread:
  - Draft the thread
  - Have one person review it

### LW/Forum version (optional)
- Decide whether to publish on LessWrong and/or EA Forum
- If yes, decide content:
  - **Preferred**: Shorter version that links to Substack (better for SEO)
  - **Acceptable**: Same full text (if you prefer)
- Title should NOT be the same as Substack
- Low-effort default title: "Blog post: [title]"

### Finalise diagrams
- Ensure solid background colour: Forethought off-white #FBFAF4
- Export as separate high-quality PNG files (not just in GDoc)

### Check platform accesses
Verify you can access:
- Substack (Contributor on Forethought Substack)
- Typefully (if doing social media)
- EA Forum Forethought account (if doing Forum, details in 1Password)

### Preview image
- Choose image for social media preview
- Can use image from piece, AI-generate, or ask Lorie to generate
- **AI workflow**: Paste into "Research preview images" Claude project for 3 prompts, pick one for Gemini
