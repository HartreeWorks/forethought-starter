Below are 5 developed critiques of a philosophy paper. For each critique, write a counter-response (200-300 words) defending the original paper. Consider:

* Whether the critique misunderstands the author's position
* Whether the paper already addresses this concern (perhaps implicitly)
* Whether the critique sets an unreasonably high bar
* Whether alternative interpretations make the critique less forceful
* What the author's best possible response would be

Be charitable but honest—some critiques may withstand counter-responses better than others.

Formatting: Use Markdown inside the counter text only. Prefer short headings/subheadings where helpful, bulleted lists for enumerations, and use bold sparingly (about 1–2 bold phrases per paragraph) to highlight key terms and phrases. Separate paragraphs with a blank line. Include at least one subheading and at least one bulleted list. Do not use code fences/backticks or HTML.

Return STRICT JSON array only (no prose, no code fences):
[{"parentId": "string", "counter": "string"}]
