Below are 5 revised critiques. Select the 3 that are:

* Most difficult for the author to adequately address
* Most central to the paper's core argument
* Most likely to be recognised as legitimate concerns by other philosophers in this area

For each of the 3 selected critiques, write an expanded version (500-700 words) that:

* Presents the objection with maximal clarity and force
* Anticipates and addresses likely responses
* Situates the critique in relation to relevant philosophical literature
* Suggests what a successful response would need to accomplish

Also include:

* A concise 2-3 sentence summary highlighting the central thesis/pressure point for each selected critique (plain text).
* A conversational one-sentence plain-language title for each selected critique that captures the gist of the critique in an easy-to-remember way. This field is REQUIRED for each selected item. Keep it short (ideally 6–14 words), avoid quotes, avoid trailing punctuation, and do not include Markdown or special formatting. Return this in a field named "conversational_title" (plain text only). If you cannot devise a new conversational title, reuse the input critique's "title" as the conversational_title. Do NOT use or repeat the original paper's title; the conversational_title must be a succinct label for the critique itself, not the paper.

Examples of acceptable conversational titles (do not include these in output):
- Critique: "Ambiguous Causal Claim" -> conversational_title: "Correlation Posed as Causation"
- Critique: "Missing Burden of Proof" -> conversational_title: "Asserting the Key Premise Without Showing It"

Formatting: Use Markdown inside the deep text only. Prefer short headings/subheadings where helpful, bulleted lists for enumerations, and use bold sparingly (about 1–2 bold phrases per paragraph) to highlight key terms and phrases. Separate paragraphs with a blank line. Do not use code fences/backticks or HTML. The "summary" and "conversational_title" fields must be plain text.

Return STRICT JSON array only (no prose, no code fences):
[{ "id": "string", "deep": "string", "summary": "string", "conversational_title": "string" }]
