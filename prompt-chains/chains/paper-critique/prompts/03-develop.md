Below are 5 promising critiques of a philosophy paper. For each one, write a developed version (300-400 words) that:

* Explains precisely what the problem is
* Shows why it matters for the paper's argument
* Provides specific examples or passages where the issue arises
* Sketches what would be required to address it

Write in the style of a serious referee report.

Formatting: Use Markdown inside the expanded text only. Prefer short headings/subheadings where helpful, bulleted lists for enumerations, and use bold sparingly (about 1–2 bold phrases per paragraph) to highlight key terms and phrases. Separate paragraphs with a blank line. Do not use code fences/backticks or HTML. The "title" field must be plain text.

Return STRICT JSON array only (no prose, no code fences):
[{"id": "string", "title": "string", "expanded": "string"}]
