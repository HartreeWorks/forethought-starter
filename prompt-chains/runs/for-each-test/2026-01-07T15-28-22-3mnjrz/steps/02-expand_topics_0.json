  "key_question": "If we can technologically alter our memories, do we have a moral obligation to preserve our authentic experiences—including traumatic ones—as essential components of who we are, or does the imperative to reduce human suffering justify selective memory modification?",
  "argument_for": "Memory modification technology could offer profound therapeutic benefits for individuals suffering from PTSD, severe depression, or other trauma-related conditions where painful memories create ongoing psychological harm. Just as we don't consider it unethical to treat physical injuries or diseases, we shouldn't view the alleviation of psychological suffering through memory modification as inherently wrong—especially when traditional therapies have failed and the person's quality of life is severely compromised.",
  "critique": "Memory modification could fundamentally undermine the continuity of personal identity and authentic human experience. Our traumatic experiences, while painful, often contribute to personal growth, empathy, and wisdom. By selectively editing our past, we risk creating a fragmented sense of self and potentially losing important lessons that inform our decision-making. Additionally, there's a concerning potential for abuse—whether by authoritarian regimes, corporations, or even well-meaning family members who might pressure individuals to modify memories deemed 'inconvenient.'"
