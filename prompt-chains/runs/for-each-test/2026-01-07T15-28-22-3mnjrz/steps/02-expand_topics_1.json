  "key_question": "If creativity is fundamentally about novel expression and meaning-making, can algorithmic systems that lack consciousness and intentionality truly create, or do they simply recombine existing patterns in ways that appear creative to human observers?",
  "argument_for": "This topic is crucial to explore as AI-generated content becomes increasingly sophisticated and prevalent across creative industries. Understanding the nature of machine creativity will help us redefine human artistic value, establish appropriate attribution and ownership frameworks, and determine how to integrate AI tools ethically into creative processes while preserving the unique aspects of human expression.",
  "critique": "This debate may be fundamentally unanswerable because it relies on contested definitions of consciousness, intentionality, and creativity that we don't fully understand even in humans. Additionally, focusing too heavily on whether machines are 'truly' creative might distract from more practical concerns about AI's impact on creative livelihoods, cultural authenticity, and the democratization versus commodification of artistic expression."
