"These three topics converge around a fundamental tension between preserving authentic human experience and using technology to optimize outcomes, whether through memory modification, AI creativity, or decisions affecting future generations. Each debate grapples with the challenge of making moral judgments about entities or experiences that exist in ambiguous states—modified memories that blur authentic identity, AI systems that may or may not truly create, and future people who may never exist. Ultimately, all three topics force us to confront how we define and value core human qualities like identity, creativity, and moral responsibility in an age where technology increasingly allows us to reshape these fundamental aspects of existence."
