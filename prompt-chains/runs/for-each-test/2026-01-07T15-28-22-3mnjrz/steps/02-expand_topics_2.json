  "key_question": "If future generations don't yet exist and may never exist, can we meaningfully say we have moral duties toward them, and how do we weigh their potential interests against the concrete needs of people alive today?",
  "argument_for": "Our current decisions about climate change, resource depletion, and technological risks will profoundly shape the world future generations inherit, making it morally irresponsible to ignore their potential welfare simply because they don't yet exist - just as we wouldn't poison a well knowing someone will drink from it later, even if we don't know their identity.",
  "critique": "This framework leads to paralyzing moral demands and logical contradictions - we cannot have duties to beings whose very existence depends on our choices, since different decisions create different people rather than helping or harming the same individuals, and prioritizing hypothetical future people over actual present suffering seems to invert moral priorities."
