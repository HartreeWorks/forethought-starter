            "argument_for": "Memory modification technology could offer profound therapeutic benefits for individuals suffering from PTSD, severe depression, or other trauma-related conditions where painful memories create ongoing psychological harm. Just as we don't consider it unethical to treat physical injuries or diseases, we shouldn't view the alleviation of psychological suffering through memory modification as inherently wrong—especially when traditional therapies have failed and the person's quality of life is severely compromised.",
            "critique": "Memory modification could fundamentally undermine the continuity of personal identity and authentic human experience. Our traumatic experiences, while painful, often contribute to personal growth, empathy, and wisdom. By selectively editing our past, we risk creating a fragmented sense of self and potentially losing important lessons that inform our decision-making. Additionally, there's a concerning potential for abuse—whether by authoritarian regimes, corporations, or even well-meaning family members who might pressure individuals to modify memories deemed 'inconvenient.'"

Ultimately, all three topics force us to confront how we define and value core human qualities like identity, creativity, and moral responsibility in an age where technology increasingly allows us to reshape these fundamental aspects of existence.",
