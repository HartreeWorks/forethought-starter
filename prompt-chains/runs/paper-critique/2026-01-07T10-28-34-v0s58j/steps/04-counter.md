## The Multiplicative Assumption Has Strong Philosophical Grounding

The critique mischaracterizes the paper's treatment of multiplicative value aggregation. The paper **implicitly draws on threshold theories** of moral adequacy—the idea that certain moral minimums must be met for a future to count as genuinely eutopian. This philosophical foundation appears in Section 3.1's discussion of "moral bottlenecks," where the authors argue that severe deficiencies in core areas like justice or welfare create **qualitative failures** that cannot be compensated by excellence elsewhere.

## Alternative Interpretations Support Multiplicative Logic

The multiplicative approach captures something important that additive models miss: **moral prerequisites** for valuable futures. Consider analogous cases:

* A society with perfect welfare distribution but systematic rights violations
* A future with excellent individual flourishing but catastrophic environmental destruction
* High aggregate utility achieved through morally abhorrent means

In each case, additive approaches might yield high overall scores despite fundamental moral failures. The multiplicative model better reflects the intuition that certain moral dimensions are **non-substitutable**.

## The Critique Sets an Unreasonably High Bar

Demanding "fundamental reconceptualization" overstates the problem. The paper's sensitivity analysis (Section 4.3) already shows that conclusions hold under various parameter specifications. More importantly, the authors explicitly acknowledge this as **one modeling choice among others** and invite further research using alternative aggregation functions. The multiplicative approach provides a useful starting point for formal analysis rather than claiming universal validity across all moral frameworks.

## The Gambling Framework Is More Inclusive Than Claimed

This critique overstates the exclusivity of the gambling-based approach. The paper's methodology doesn't require accepting **utilitarian calculations** about fundamental rights—rather, it asks what risks different moral theories would accept to secure their own distinctive goods. A rights-theorist can meaningfully assess probabilistic threats to rights without reducing rights to utility.

## The Method Accommodates Non-Consequentialist Insights

Section 2.3 demonstrates how deontological constraints can be incorporated through **lexicographic preferences** and threshold effects within the gambling framework. The approach captures virtue ethics concerns by including character-based goods in the outcome space. Rather than imposing consequentialist logic, the method provides a **neutral formal structure** that different theories can populate with their own values.

## False Precision Concerns Are Addressed

The paper explicitly acknowledges measurement limitations and employs **robust uncertainty modeling** rather than claiming false precision. The analysis focuses on:

* Qualitative patterns across different parameter ranges
* Sensitivity analysis for key assumptions  
* **Ordinal comparisons** rather than precise cardinal measurements

## The Alternative Is Analytical Paralysis

The critique offers no workable alternative for systematic moral analysis across theoretical frameworks. While some moral goods resist quantification, the gambling approach provides **tractable approximations** that enable progress on important questions. Perfect theoretical purity that prevents any formal analysis serves neither philosophical rigor nor practical moral reasoning about civilizational futures.

## The Paper Employs Reasonable Pragmatic Solutions

While acknowledging the theoretical depth of intertheoretic comparison problems, this critique sets an impossibly high bar. The paper adopts a **pragmatic overlapping consensus** approach, focusing on moral judgments where different theories converge rather than claiming to solve fundamental meta-ethical problems. Section 5.2 explicitly limits conclusions to areas of **theoretical agreement**.

## The Analysis Remains Meaningful Without Perfect Commensurability

The critique assumes that meaningful analysis requires complete theoretical unity. However, the paper's approach of:

* Identifying **convergent moral concerns** across theories
* Analyzing fragility patterns within specific frameworks
* Examining **robust conclusions** that hold across multiple approaches

Provides valuable insights even without solving deep meta-ethical puzzles. Many successful philosophical projects proceed without resolving all foundational questions.

## Alternative Interpretations Reduce the Problem's Severity

The paper can be read as **conditional analysis**: "Given that we care about moral progress, here are systematic ways to think about fragility risks." This interpretation avoids strong claims about intertheoretic aggregation while still providing **actionable insights** for moral agents operating within particular frameworks.

## The Critique Misses Practical Value

Even imperfect theoretical foundations can generate **practically important conclusions**. The paper's analysis of institutional safeguards, coordination problems, and moral uncertainty provides valuable guidance for civilizational planning. Demanding complete meta-ethical resolution before proceeding with formal moral analysis would essentially **halt progress** on urgent questions about humanity's long-term moral trajectory.

## Institutional Analysis Is Present But Could Be Expanded

This critique understates the paper's treatment of institutional factors. Section 6 explicitly discusses **coordination mechanisms** and their role in reducing moral fragility, while Section 4.4 incorporates institutional robustness into the formal modeling. The paper acknowledges that well-designed institutions can create **structural safeguards** against individual moral failures.

## The Focus on Individual-Level Analysis Is Methodologically Sound

The paper's emphasis on individual moral judgment reflects a reasonable **analytical division of labor**. Understanding baseline moral fragility provides the foundation for evaluating institutional solutions. The critique's suggested institutional analysis would require:

* Separate treatment of institutional design principles
* **Complex modeling** of institutional evolution and breakdown
* Analysis of meta-institutional problems

This represents a substantial research program beyond the current paper's scope.

## Existing Analysis Implicitly Addresses Institutional Factors

The paper's discussion of **moral coordination problems** (Section 3.4) and collective action challenges inherently involves institutional considerations. The fragility calculations incorporate scenarios where institutional failures contribute to moral catastrophes, suggesting the authors **recognize institutional importance** even if not fully developing this dimension.

## The Critique Identifies Valuable Extensions Rather Than Fatal Flaws

Rather than undermining the paper's core contributions, this critique points toward **productive research directions**. The paper provides a foundational analysis that future work can build upon by incorporating institutional factors more systematically. The current analysis remains valuable for understanding the **baseline challenges** that institutional solutions must address.

## Formal Requirements Enable Rather Than Constrain Analysis

This critique misunderstands the relationship between formal constraints and substantive conclusions. The paper's mathematical requirements provide **analytical tractability** without prejudging moral questions. Section 2.4 explicitly discusses how incomplete preferences can be accommodated through **interval-valued utilities** and partial ordering approaches.

## Excluded Frameworks Can Still Inform the Analysis

Moral theories violating completeness or VNM axioms aren't ignored—they're incorporated through **sensitivity analysis** and robustness checks. The paper examines how conclusions change when key assumptions are relaxed, allowing insights from more flexible moral frameworks to influence the overall assessment.

## The Selection Bias Claim Lacks Evidence

The critique assumes that formal constraints systematically favor pessimistic theories, but provides no evidence for this claim. Many **optimistic moral frameworks** satisfy the paper's requirements:

* Progressive utilitarian theories emphasizing moral learning
* **Capability-based approaches** allowing multiple paths to flourishing  
* Rights theories with built-in adaptability mechanisms

The formal structure is **theoretically neutral** regarding optimism versus pessimism.

## Alternative Approaches Face Their Own Limitations

The suggested alternatives (partial orders, multi-criteria analysis) involve their own restrictive assumptions and methodological constraints. **Perfect methodological inclusivity** is impossible—any systematic analysis requires some formal structure. The paper's approach represents a reasonable balance between analytical rigor and theoretical flexibility.

## The Paper Already Acknowledges Methodological Limitations

Section 7's discussion of future research explicitly recognizes how **methodological choices shape conclusions** and calls for alternative formal approaches. This demonstrates appropriate scholarly humility rather than the dogmatic commitment to particular methods that the critique suggests.
