    "title": "The Multiplicative Value Assumption Lacks Justification and Drives Pessimistic Conclusions",
    "expanded": "## The Core Problem\n\nThe paper's formal analysis of **moral fragility** relies fundamentally on the assumption that value across different moral dimensions is multiplicative rather than additive. This means that if a future scores poorly on any single dimension, the overall value collapses toward zero. However, the paper provides **no philosophical justification** for why value should combine multiplicatively rather than through alternative aggregation functions.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThis assumption is not merely technical—it **drives the paper's pessimistic conclusions** about achieving eutopia. Under multiplicative aggregation, a future must excel across all moral dimensions simultaneously to achieve high value. Even modest shortcomings in any area drastically reduce overall worth. By contrast, additive or weighted-average approaches would allow excellence in some dimensions to compensate for deficiencies in others, making eutopia substantially more achievable.\n\n## Specific Examples\n\nThe fragility calculation in Section 4.2 demonstrates this bias clearly. When the paper models a future with high welfare but moderate justice scores, the multiplicative function yields dramatically lower overall value than intuitive moral reasoning might suggest. The mathematical framework essentially **builds in pessimism** by requiring perfection across all dimensions rather than allowing for reasonable trade-offs that most moral theories would accept.\n\n## Required Remediation\n\nAddressing this critique would require **fundamental reconceptualization** of the formal framework. The authors must either: (1) provide compelling philosophical arguments for why value must be multiplicative—perhaps drawing on threshold theories of moral adequacy, (2) demonstrate that their conclusions hold under alternative aggregation functions like weighted sums or lexicographic orderings, or (3) acknowledge that their results depend critically on this controversial assumption and may not generalize to other plausible value theories. Without such justification, the paper's mathematical sophistication obscures rather than illuminates the underlying moral questions."

    "title": "The Gambling-Based Value Quantification Method Excludes Major Moral Frameworks",
    "expanded": "## The Methodological Problem\n\nThe paper's approach to **quantifying moral value** relies heavily on gambling comparisons—asking what risks agents would accept to achieve certain outcomes. This method assumes that meaningful moral values can be extracted through risk-neutral quantification procedures. However, this approach systematically **excludes major moral frameworks** that reject such probabilistic reasoning about fundamental moral goods.\n\n## Philosophical Frameworks at Stake\n\nMany deontological theories hold that certain moral goods cannot be meaningfully traded off against probabilistic outcomes. Rights-based theories, for instance, typically reject the idea that violating fundamental rights can be justified by probabilistic calculations about aggregate welfare. Similarly, **virtue ethics frameworks** often resist reducing moral worth to quantifiable units amenable to gambling comparisons, instead emphasizing qualitative assessments of character and flourishing that resist numerical representation.\n\n## Impact on the Analysis\n\nThis methodological choice **biases the sample** of moral theories under consideration toward those already comfortable with consequentialist calculation. The paper's conclusions about moral fragility may therefore reflect the particular features of utilitarian and related frameworks rather than capturing broader truths about moral value. More fundamentally, the gambling approach may artificially impose **false precision** on moral judgments that are inherently qualitative or incommensurable.\n\n## Path Forward\n\nTo address this critique, the authors must either: (1) provide robust philosophical defense of why gambling-based quantification captures something essential about moral value that other approaches miss, (2) develop alternative measurement methods that can accommodate non-consequentialist moral frameworks—perhaps through qualitative comparative assessments or threshold-based approaches, or (3) explicitly limit their claims to apply only to moral theories that accept probabilistic quantification, while acknowledging this significantly **narrows the scope** of their conclusions about moral progress and eutopian possibilities."

    "title": "The Unresolved Intertheoretic Comparison Problem Undermines the Project's Coherence",
    "expanded": "## The Fundamental Logical Gap\n\nThe paper acknowledges but fails to resolve a **crucial logical problem**: how to meaningfully compare and aggregate judgments across fundamentally different moral theories. While the authors recognize this challenge in passing, they proceed with their formal analysis as if the problem were merely technical rather than potentially fatal to the entire enterprise.\n\n## Why This Threatens Coherence\n\nThe paper's conclusions about moral fragility and eutopian difficulty depend essentially on **aggregating assessments** across diverse moral frameworks—utilitarian, deontological, virtue-based, and others. But these theories often employ incommensurable concepts of value, different logical structures, and incompatible methods of moral reasoning. Without a principled solution to intertheoretic comparison, the mathematical apparatus becomes **meaningless formal manipulation** rather than genuine moral analysis.\n\n## Manifestation in the Analysis\n\nThis problem surfaces most clearly in Section 5's attempt to calculate overall \"moral risk\" by combining probability assessments from different theoretical perspectives. The paper treats a utilitarian's welfare calculations and a deontologist's rights-based concerns as if they were **comparable quantities** that can be meaningfully averaged or weighted. But this assumes a meta-theoretical framework that the paper never articulates or defends.\n\n## Requirements for Resolution\n\nAddressing this critique demands **fundamental theoretical work** that the paper currently lacks. The authors must either: (1) develop and defend a robust meta-ethical framework that provides principled methods for intertheoretic comparison—perhaps through overlapping consensus approaches or hierarchical value structures, (2) abandon the aggregative approach in favor of analyzing how different theories individually assess moral fragility, or (3) acknowledge that their conclusions hold only within specific theoretical frameworks rather than providing **general insights** about moral progress. Without such foundational work, the paper's sophisticated mathematical treatment obscures rather than resolves the underlying philosophical challenges."

    "title": "Neglect of Coordination Mechanisms and Institutions Leads to Overestimating Moral Fragility",
    "expanded": "## The Missing Institutional Dimension\n\nThe paper's analysis of **moral catastrophe likelihood** treats moral decision-making as if it occurs in an institutional vacuum. It focuses on individual moral judgment and small-group dynamics while largely ignoring how coordination mechanisms, institutional design, and governance structures could substantially alter the probability of moral failures at civilizational scale.\n\n## Concrete Institutional Solutions Overlooked\n\nThe analysis fails to consider several categories of institutional innovation that could **dramatically reduce moral fragility**: constitutional protections for fundamental rights that constrain majoritarian moral errors, international coordination mechanisms that prevent races to the moral bottom, deliberative institutions that improve collective moral reasoning, and monitoring systems that provide early warning of moral drift. These aren't merely theoretical possibilities—we observe such institutions successfully preventing moral catastrophes in various domains today.\n\n## Impact on Probability Assessments\n\nBy ignoring institutional factors, the paper likely **overestimates the difficulty** of achieving and maintaining eutopian conditions. The fragility calculations in Section 4 assume that moral performance depends primarily on the aggregate quality of individual moral judgments. But well-designed institutions can systematically improve moral outcomes even when individual moral capacities remain limited, creating **structural safeguards** against the types of moral failures the paper identifies as most threatening.\n\n## Required Analysis\n\nTo address this gap, the paper needs **substantial additional analysis** examining how institutional design interacts with moral fragility. This would require: (1) systematic review of existing institutional mechanisms that successfully prevent moral failures, (2) formal modeling of how coordination institutions affect the probability distributions used in the fragility calculations, (3) analysis of institutional robustness and the **meta-problem** of designing institutions that remain effective across moral and technological change, and (4) integration of institutional factors into the overall assessment of eutopian achievability. Without this institutional dimension, the paper provides an incomplete and potentially misleading analysis of long-term moral risk."

    "title": "Restrictive Formal Requirements Systematically Exclude Optimistic Moral Frameworks",
    "expanded": "## The Problematic Formal Constraints\n\nThe paper imposes **restrictive mathematical requirements** on moral views, particularly completeness (every pair of outcomes must be comparable) and von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms for decision under uncertainty. While these constraints enable elegant formal analysis, they systematically exclude moral frameworks that might be more optimistic about achieving eutopian conditions.\n\n## Excluded Moral Approaches\n\nMany sophisticated moral theories reject completeness, allowing for **genuine moral incomparability** between certain outcomes rather than forcing artificial rankings. Similarly, moral frameworks emphasizing moral uncertainty, contextual judgment, or irreducible value pluralism often violate VNM axioms by rejecting the independence assumptions underlying expected utility theory. These excluded theories might be more **optimistic about moral progress** precisely because they allow for flexible responses to novel moral challenges.\n\n## Selection Bias Toward Pessimism\n\nThe formal requirements create a **systematic selection bias** toward moral theories that are more likely to generate pessimistic conclusions about eutopia. Theories requiring complete moral orderings tend to be more demanding and fragile, since they must provide determinate answers even in cases of deep moral uncertainty. More flexible frameworks that acknowledge irreducible moral complexity might suggest that **partial moral progress** is sufficient for valuable futures, making eutopia more achievable.\n\n## Methodological Reforms Required\n\nAddressing this critique requires **fundamental methodological changes**: (1) explicit justification for why the chosen formal constraints capture essential features of moral reasoning rather than merely enabling mathematical tractability, (2) sensitivity analysis showing how conclusions change under alternative formal frameworks that accommodate incomplete preferences and non-expected utility reasoning, (3) development of **alternative formal methods** that can handle moral frameworks violating standard axioms—perhaps through partial order approaches or multi-criteria decision analysis, and (4) acknowledgment of how methodological choices shape substantive conclusions about moral fragility. Without such reforms, the paper's mathematical sophistication may inadvertently **prejudge the very questions** it seeks to illuminate."
