# Brainstorm critiques

## Arbitrary value thresholds

**Category:** Questionable premises

The 50% threshold for 'mostly-great' and 90% for 'near-best' futures appear arbitrary and lack philosophical justification. Different thresholds could dramatically alter the conclusions about eutopian difficulty.

## Gamble-based value definition

**Category:** Alternative interpretations

Defining value quantities through gambling comparisons may not capture how reasonable moral views actually assess outcomes. Many moral frameworks reject such risk-neutral quantification of value.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 5/10 | 8/10 |

## Multiplicative value assumption

**Category:** Logical weaknesses

The claim that value is multiplicative across dimensions lacks justification and conflicts with many moral theories that allow compensation between goods. This assumption drives much of the 'fragility' conclusion.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 7/10 | 9/10 |

## Historical moral catastrophe analogy

**Category:** Questionable premises

The argument assumes historical moral failures predict future ones, but technological abundance and moral progress could break this pattern. The analogy may not hold for unprecedented future conditions.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 4/10 | 6/10 |

---

## Fat-tailed distribution assumption

**Category:** Empirical claims

The claim that value-efficiency follows fat-tailed distributions is speculative and based on weak analogies to wealth and citations. Future value distributions could be fundamentally different.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 6/10 | 7/10 |

---

## Resource separability requirement

**Category:** Questionable premises

Linear views requiring resource separability may be too restrictive. Many plausible moral views allow for emergent value from resource combinations that isn't captured by additive models.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 6/10 | 6/10 |

---

## Bounded view classification

**Category:** Gaps in argumentation

The taxonomy of bounded views seems incomplete and may miss hybrid approaches. The sharp distinction between 'joint' and 'separate' aggregation overlooks more nuanced aggregation methods.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 5/10 | 7/10 |

---

## Intertheoretic comparison problems

**Category:** Logical weaknesses

The paper acknowledges but doesn't resolve fundamental problems with comparing across moral theories. The various normalization methods yield contradictory conclusions, undermining the overall argument.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 4/10 | 8/10 |

---

## Digital beings speculation

**Category:** Empirical claims

Claims about digital beings and their moral status are highly speculative. The argument assumes digital beings will exist in vast numbers and have moral status, which remains uncertain.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 3/10 | 5/10 |

---

## Scale insensitivity critique

**Category:** Alternative interpretations

The paper criticizes scope insensitivity but may itself suffer from it by treating galactic-scale futures as obviously more valuable. Some moral views reasonably discount or cap the value of scale.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 6/10 | 6/10 |

---

## Common-sense utopia strawman

**Category:** Gaps in argumentation

The 'common-sense utopia' example may be a strawman that doesn't represent sophisticated easygoing views. More nuanced liberal positions might avoid the catalogued problems.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 4/10 | 5/10 |

---

## Moral convergence dismissal

**Category:** Scope limitations

The paper largely ignores the possibility that moral views might converge toward truth through reflection and discourse. This convergence could make eutopia more achievable than the analysis suggests.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 5/10 | 7/10 |

---

## Population ethics overemphasis

**Category:** Overgeneralisations

The argument places disproportionate weight on population ethics disagreements. Many moral catastrophes could be avoided even with imperfect population-ethical views.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 4/10 | 6/10 |

---

## Technological determinism

**Category:** Questionable premises

The paper assumes technological capabilities (like space settlement) without considering whether such developments are inevitable or desirable from various moral perspectives.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 3/10 | 5/10 |

---

## Moral error inevitability

**Category:** Logical weaknesses

The argument seems to assume moral errors are inevitable without adequately considering institutional and procedural safeguards that could minimize such errors.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 5/10 | 6/10 |

---

## Value function completeness

**Category:** Questionable premises

The requirement that moral views be complete and satisfy von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms excludes many reasonable moral frameworks that might be more easygoing about eutopia.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 6/10 | 7/10 |

---

## Extinction baseline arbitrariness

**Category:** Ambiguities

Setting extinction as the zero point for value comparisons is arbitrary and could bias the analysis. Different baselines might yield different conclusions about eutopian difficulty.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 4/10 | 6/10 |

---

## Hedonic treadmill analogy weakness

**Category:** Questionable premises

The hedonic treadmill analogy may not apply to societal-level value judgments. Collective moral progress could differ fundamentally from individual satisfaction dynamics.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 3/10 | 5/10 |

---

## Resource allocation fatalism

**Category:** Gaps in argumentation

The paper doesn't adequately consider how governance institutions and coordination mechanisms could improve resource allocation decisions, potentially making eutopia more achievable.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 5/10 | 6/10 |

---

## Moral catastrophe definition vagueness

**Category:** Ambiguities

The concept of 'moral catastrophe' remains poorly defined, making it unclear when a future truly loses 'most of its value' rather than just being imperfect.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 4/10 | 7/10 |

---

## Empirical examples cherry-picking

**Category:** Empirical claims

The examples of extreme experiences (Russell, Dostoevsky) and value distributions may be cherry-picked to support the fat-tailed hypothesis rather than representing typical cases.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 3/10 | 5/10 |

---

## Bounded view implausibility overstated

**Category:** Overgeneralisations

The dismissal of bounded views as implausible may be too hasty. The paper doesn't fully explore how bounded views might handle the identified problems through refinements.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 5/10 | 6/10 |

---

## Future generations agency ignored

**Category:** Gaps in argumentation

The analysis treats future moral errors as inevitable rather than considering how future generations might actively work to avoid the catalogued mistakes through learning and institutions.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 6/10 | 7/10 |

---

## Meta-ethical assumptions

**Category:** Questionable premises

The paper assumes moral realism and that there are objective facts about value, but on anti-realist views, the entire framework of 'getting morality right' becomes questionable.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 4/10 | 6/10 |

---

## Coordination possibility underexplored

**Category:** Scope limitations

The paper doesn't sufficiently consider how coordination mechanisms, international institutions, and value-aligned AI could help navigate moral disagreements and avoid catastrophic errors.

| Novelty | Risk |
|---------|------|
| 6/10 | 8/10 |
