    "revised": "## Acknowledging the Threshold Theory Connection\n\nThe counter-response correctly identifies that multiplicative aggregation can reflect **threshold theories of moral adequacy**. This connection to moral bottlenecks and non-substitutable moral dimensions has philosophical merit and wasn't adequately recognized in the original critique.\n\n## The Remaining Justification Problem\n\nHowever, even granting this threshold interpretation, **fundamental problems persist**. The paper never explains why the specific multiplicative function V = ∏Vi captures threshold effects better than alternatives like lexicographic orderings or step-function thresholds. Why should a society scoring 0.8 on welfare and 0.9 on justice receive overall value 0.72 rather than being evaluated lexicographically or through **explicit threshold criteria**?\n\n## Limited Scope of Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThe claimed sensitivity analysis in Section 4.3 examines only parameter variations within the multiplicative framework, not **alternative aggregation functions**. This leaves the core structural assumption untested. The paper's conclusions about eutopian difficulty may be artifacts of this specific mathematical choice rather than robust insights about moral progress.\n\n## Required Comparative Analysis\n\nTo address these concerns, the paper needs:\n\n* **Direct comparison** with lexicographic and threshold-based models using identical input parameters\n* Explicit justification for why continuous multiplicative functions better capture threshold intuitions than discrete threshold models\n* Analysis of whether the **pessimistic conclusions** about eutopian achievability hold under plausible alternative aggregation methods\n* Clear acknowledgment of how this foundational choice shapes substantive conclusions\n\nWithout such comparative work, the philosophical grounding remains insufficient to support the paper's strong claims about moral fragility and civilizational risk."

    "revised": "## Recognizing Methodological Flexibility\n\nThe counter-response demonstrates that the gambling framework is more theoretically inclusive than initially claimed. The accommodation of **lexicographic preferences** and threshold effects, along with the focus on ordinal rather than cardinal precision, addresses some concerns about methodological bias.\n\n## Persistent Theoretical Exclusions\n\nNevertheless, significant exclusions remain. Many sophisticated moral frameworks fundamentally reject **probabilistic reasoning** about certain moral goods, regardless of whether those probabilities concern rights, welfare, or virtue. Consider moral theories that:\n\n* Treat certain values as **categorically incommensurable** with risk calculations\n* Emphasize contextual moral judgment that resists systematic quantification\n* Ground moral worth in **relational properties** that cannot be captured through outcome-focused gambling scenarios\n\n## The Neutrality Claim Requires Scrutiny\n\nThe assertion that gambling frameworks provide \"neutral formal structure\" is questionable. By requiring all moral theories to express their commitments through **risk-acceptance scenarios**, the method privileges frameworks already comfortable with consequentialist-style reasoning. This isn't mere technical constraint—it shapes which moral insights can influence the analysis.\n\n## Toward More Inclusive Methodology\n\nRather than analytical paralysis, the solution involves **methodological pluralism**:\n\n* Developing parallel analyses using qualitative comparative methods for theories rejecting quantification\n* Creating **hybrid approaches** that combine gambling-based and non-probabilistic moral reasoning\n* Explicitly acknowledging which conclusions depend on the gambling framework versus representing broader moral insights\n* Testing whether core findings about moral fragility hold when derived through alternative methodological approaches\n\nThis would strengthen rather than abandon systematic analysis while avoiding **premature methodological closure**."

    "revised": "## Acknowledging Pragmatic Constraints\n\nThe counter-response reasonably notes that demanding complete resolution of intertheoretic comparison problems sets an impossibly high standard. The **overlapping consensus** approach and focus on areas of theoretical convergence represent legitimate pragmatic strategies for making progress on complex moral questions.\n\n## The Remaining Coherence Challenge\n\nHowever, the paper's actual implementation goes beyond modest overlapping consensus. Section 5's **aggregative risk calculations** require numerical weighting and combination of assessments from fundamentally different moral frameworks. This isn't merely identifying convergent concerns—it's performing mathematical operations that assume commensurable value scales.\n\n## Conditional Analysis Interpretation Problems\n\nThe suggested \"conditional analysis\" interpretation faces difficulties. If the paper's conclusions hold only within specific theoretical frameworks, then claims about **general moral fragility** and civilizational risk become much weaker. The paper cannot simultaneously claim broad relevance for long-term planning while retreating to framework-specific conditional analysis.\n\n## Required Methodological Clarity\n\nTo address these concerns, the paper needs:\n\n* **Explicit specification** of which conclusions depend on intertheoretic aggregation versus representing intra-theoretical analysis\n* Clear acknowledgment of the **scope limitations** imposed by pragmatic methodological choices\n* Separate presentation of results that hold within individual moral frameworks versus those requiring cross-theoretical combination\n* Direct engagement with whether the most practically important conclusions about moral risk survive without controversial aggregative assumptions\n\nThis would preserve the paper's valuable insights while avoiding **overconfident claims** about having resolved deep meta-ethical challenges through pragmatic workarounds."

    "revised": "## Recognizing Existing Institutional Discussion\n\nThe counter-response correctly notes that institutional factors receive some attention in Sections 6 and 4.4. The paper does acknowledge **coordination mechanisms** and incorporates institutional robustness considerations into its formal modeling, which the original critique understated.\n\n## The Analytical Imbalance Problem\n\nHowever, significant **analytical imbalance** remains. The paper devotes extensive formal apparatus to individual-level moral fragility while treating institutional solutions largely qualitatively. This creates misleading precision—the mathematical models suggest high fragility probabilities based on individual moral failures, while institutional safeguards receive only brief conceptual discussion.\n\n## Impact on Core Conclusions\n\nThis imbalance matters because institutional factors could dramatically alter the paper's **quantitative assessments** of moral catastrophe risk. The formal fragility calculations assume that civilizational moral performance depends primarily on aggregate individual moral judgment. But robust institutional design might reduce these risks by orders of magnitude—a possibility the current analysis cannot evaluate.\n\n## Required Integration Rather Than Extension\n\nThe solution isn't merely \"future research\" but **methodological integration**. The paper's core contribution—formal moral fragility analysis—remains incomplete without:\n\n* **Quantitative modeling** of how institutional mechanisms affect the probability distributions used in fragility calculations\n* Systematic analysis of institutional robustness and failure modes that could undermine moral safeguards\n* Integration of institutional factors into the **central risk assessments** rather than relegating them to qualitative discussion\n* Explicit acknowledgment of how institutional considerations might alter the paper's conclusions about eutopian achievability\n\nWithout such integration, the paper's sophisticated individual-level analysis may systematically **overestimate civilizational moral risk** by underweighting institutional solutions that could provide structural safeguards against the moral failures it identifies."

    "revised": "## Acknowledging Methodological Sophistication\n\nThe counter-response demonstrates greater methodological flexibility than initially recognized. The accommodation of **interval-valued utilities** and partial orderings, along with explicit acknowledgment of methodological limitations, shows appropriate scholarly nuance.\n\n## The Tractability-Inclusivity Tension\n\nHowever, a fundamental tension remains between **analytical tractability** and theoretical inclusivity. While the paper claims to accommodate incomplete preferences through interval utilities, the core formal analysis still requires sufficient structure to generate determinate conclusions about moral fragility. This creates pressure toward more complete, systematized moral frameworks.\n\n## Selection Effects on Theoretical Sample\n\nThe neutrality claim requires scrutiny. Consider which moral theories can readily satisfy the paper's formal requirements versus those that cannot:\n\n**More Compatible**: Systematic utilitarian theories, formal rights frameworks with clear priority rules, **quantified capability approaches**\n\n**Less Compatible**: Contextual virtue ethics, particularist moral theories, **radical moral uncertainty** frameworks, indigenous moral systems emphasizing relational rather than systematic reasoning\n\nThis pattern suggests **systematic rather than random** exclusions that could bias conclusions about moral progress.\n\n## Beyond Methodological Acknowledgment\n\nThe paper's recognition of methodological limitations in Section 7, while valuable, doesn't address how these limitations affect **substantive conclusions**. The analysis needs:\n\n* **Explicit examination** of whether core findings about moral fragility hold when derived through alternative formal approaches\n* Direct comparison with conclusions that would emerge from methodologies more hospitable to excluded moral frameworks\n* Clear specification of which claims about **eutopian difficulty** depend on the particular formal structure versus representing more general insights\n* Acknowledgment of how methodological choices may systematically favor certain types of moral theories over others\n\nThis would strengthen the paper's contributions while avoiding **false universality** about conclusions that may reflect methodological rather than substantive constraints."
