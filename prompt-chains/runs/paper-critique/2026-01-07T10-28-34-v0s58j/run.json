    "paper": "# No Easy Eutopia: Why Great Futures Are Hard to Achieve\n\n1\\. Introduction\n----------------\n\nThe [basic argument for the “better futures” perspective](https://www.forethought.org/research/introducing-better-futures#1-the-basic-case) relied on the idea that we are closer to the ceiling on _Surviving_ than we are on _Flourishing_. If, however, we are very likely to get to a near-best future given survival, then there’s more to gain from ensuring we survive, and there’s less potential upside from improving those futures where we do survive.\n\n![Chart comparing value loss from survival vs flourishing risks: small red area shows 20% extinction risk, large blue area shows 72% value loss from non-flourishing, demonstrating flourishing has 36x greater scale](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/41DrT8Ehvh1OBpXkWvX82K/c2e8dccdd840f41a66013cf8e55e3c22/surviving-vs-flourishing-value-comparison.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp \"Surviving represents the probability of avoiding a near-zero value future this century (an “existential catastrophe”), while Flourishing represents the expected value of the future conditional on Surviving.\")\n\nSurviving represents the probability of avoiding a near-zero value future this century (an “existential catastrophe”), while Flourishing represents the expected value of the future conditional on Surviving.\n\nImage\n-----\n\nWe could be close to the ceiling of _Flourishing_ for a couple of reasons. First, eutopian futures could present a _big target_: that is, society would end up reaching a near-best outcome across a wide variety of possible futures, even without deliberately and successfully honing in on a very specific conception of an extremely good future. We call this the _easy eutopia_ view.\n\nSecond, even if the target is narrow, society might nonetheless hone in on that target — maybe because, first, society as a whole accurately converges onto the right moral view and is motivated to act on it, or, second, _some_ people have the right view and compromise between them and the rest of society is sufficient to get us the rest of the way.[1](#user-content-fn-1)\n\nAs an analogy, we could think of reaching a near-best future as an expedition to sail to an uninhabited island. The expedition is more likely to reach the island to the extent that:\n\n1.  The island is bigger, more visible, and closer to the point of departure;\n    \n2.  The ship’s navigation systems work well, and are aimed toward the island;\n    \n3.  The ship’s crew can send out smaller reconnaissance boats, and not everyone onboard the ship needs to reach the island for the expedition to succeed.\n    \n\nThis essay considers point (1). If eutopia is an island, is the island easy to reach?\n\n![Map-style illustration showing journey from \"The present\" to \"near-best future\" with three key factors: distant target, good navigation, and many attempts, using sailing expedition metaphor for reaching eutopia](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/5iPjx5ukSksWBccv7BGv5q/fbc397a61d478f184ba99c063a111a4f/sailing-to-near-best-future.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp \"If reaching a mostly-great future is like sailing to an uninhabited island, then three factors could influence the difficulty: (i) whether the island is large and close, (ii) whether the ship can navigate well, and (iii) whether the expedition can make many attempts.\")\n\nIf reaching a mostly-great future is like sailing to an uninhabited island, then three factors could influence the difficulty: (i) whether the island is large and close, (ii) whether the ship can navigate well, and (iii) whether the expedition can make many attempts.\n\nImage\n-----\n\nBefore we begin, it’s useful to define some terms:\n\n> A _best feasible future_ is a future humanity would achieve if things went exceptionally well — at the 99.99th percentile of our distribution of how well things could go.\n> \n> A _eutopia_,[2](#user-content-fn-2) or _near-best future_ is a future which is at least nearly as good as a best feasible future, or more precisely (if applicable[3](#user-content-fn-3)) at least 90% of its value.\n> \n> A _mostly-great future_ is a future which achieves at least _most_ of the potential of a best feasible future, or more precisely (if applicable) at least 50% of its value.\n\nHere’s a first-pass statement of the question we address in this essay: among all the futures humanity could achieve given survival, weighted by how likely those futures would be assuming no serious, coordinated efforts to promote the overall best outcomes (whatever they may be), what fraction of those futures live up to _most_ of the potential we could have achieved?\n\nA “no easy eutopia” view says that only a narrow range of futures achieve most the potential of the best achievable futures; and a wide range of futures fall far short — including futures which might seem fantastically advanced, grand in scale, and full of things we care about.\n\nIt’ll also be useful to talk about _quantities_ of value, which we define in terms of a betterness relation over uncertain outcomes. On this definition, we say that eutopia is over twice as good as some other future just in case a 50–50 gamble between eutopia and near-term extinction is better than a guarantee of that other future. Of course, not all reasonable moral views allow quantitative comparisons of value, but a wide variety can be represented in this way, including non-consequentialist views.[4](#user-content-fn-4)\n\nThere’s nothing magical about the “mostly great” threshold. It’s just as valuable, by our definition of value, to go from achieving 10% to 20% of the difference in value between extinction and eutopia, than it is to cross the mostly-great threshold from 45% to 55%, or achieve a true eutopia by going from 90% to 100%. But it’s useful to focus on a threshold which gives us the most relevant information about the value of the future.\n\nGiven how we’ve defined quantities of value, the “no easy eutopia” view does not seem intuitively obvious to us. If “no easy eutopia” is correct, then we should hope for a 60–40 gamble between eutopia and extinction rather than a guarantee of many futures that intuitively seem truly wonderful, and indeed would be truly wonderful, in absolute terms.[5](#user-content-fn-5) Ultimately, though, we conclude that the easy eutopia view is likely wrong. The future could fall dramatically short of what humanity could have achieved, even if we avoid obvious catastrophes, achieve a world of abundance, and if everyone today gets most of what they self-interestedly want.\n\nThe structure of this essay is as follows. In Section 2, we’ll consider how the value of the future could be fragile with respect to single flaws which may be easy to accidentally introduce, meaning that even reaching a mostly-great future could require getting things right in many non-obvious ways. We’ll illustrate this by looking at ways in which the world today could involve a moral catastrophe, and ways in which the future could involve one, too. In particular, we’ll consider mistakes which could undermine the value of the future even in a world which everyone approves of, and where everyone gets most of what they want.[6](#user-content-fn-6)\n\nWe’ll suggest that we can capture this idea of eutopian fragility by seeing the value of the future as the _product_ of many factors, such that mostly-great futures are rare even among futures which score highly across the factors on average. We’ll also consider why, psychologically speaking, it could seem like ‘ideal’ societies _should_ be easy to achieve, even if they’re not.\n\nIn Section 3, we’ll get more technical. We’ll discuss, more systematically, what it would take for a plausible moral view to be _easygoing_ about near-best futures, looking at both unbounded and bounded moral views. It turns out to be surprisingly tricky to specify an easygoing moral view: most plausible views seem to be fussy about what it takes to reach eutopia. One upshot is that, even after much more reflection, there’s little reason to think people’s moral views would become more easygoing.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems hard to avoid thinking that most achievable value lies in a narrow range of feasible outcomes. This is the “no easy eutopia” view. If future society hits that target, it would seem they must have deliberately optimised towards it; whether that will happen is discussed in [the next essay](https://www.forethought.org/research/convergence-and-compromise).\n\n2\\. Eutopia is fragile\n----------------------\n\n### 2.1. Ongoing moral catastrophes\n\nSince the agricultural revolution, most people who ever lived have lived in the midst of a moral catastrophe: in societies featuring some combination of slavery, the subjugation of women, cruel and brutal punishment for criminals or prisoners of war, widespread disenfranchisement, and rigid social stratification based on accidents of birth. Often, the fact that these arrangements were wrong wasn’t at all obvious at the time, even to the victims of those wrongs; they arose not out of resource constraints, but out of prevailing moral beliefs.\n\nToday, too, we live in the midst of a moral catastrophe.[7](#user-content-fn-7)\n\nThe scientific and technological advances of the last few centuries, and correspondingly rapid and sustained increase in material incomes, have afforded our generation an opportunity to create a truly flourishing world — but we’ve squandered that opportunity. Ongoing inequality, conflict, poverty, subjugation, and more, all mean that the world falls far short of how good it could be. What’s more, humanity’s treatment of non-human animals has led to intense suffering on an industrial scale, amounting to tens of billions of animals living lives of misery every year. The suffering directly caused by animal farming may well be enough to outweigh most or all of the gains to human wellbeing we have seen. For this reason alone, the world today may be no better overall than it was centuries ago.[8](#user-content-fn-8)\n\nThe idea that modern society has squandered most possible values is not idiosyncratic to one moral view. From many moral perspectives, the world is in the midst of an ongoing moral catastrophe.[9](#user-content-fn-9)\n\n\n\n* Moral perspective: Most religious views\n  * Moral catastrophe, from that perspective: Most people on Earth follow the wrong faith or spiritual practices, or are atheist; widespread erosion of spiritual values.\n* Moral perspective: Conservative morality\n  * Moral catastrophe, from that perspective: Most people violate norms of sexual propriety, such as sex before marriage. Marriage rates and birth rates are dropping across most countries. Other forms of decadence, like gambling and drug use, are common.\n* Moral perspective: Pro-life ethics\n  * Moral catastrophe, from that perspective: Over 70 million abortions are performed annually, more than 100 times the number of deaths from homicide.\n* Moral perspective: Cosmopolitan ethics\n  * Moral catastrophe, from that perspective: Millions of children die from easily-preventable diseases every year. Restrictive immigration policies limit freedom of movement and make the world poorer.\n* Moral perspective: Environmentalism\n  * Moral catastrophe, from that perspective: We are causing climate change, the destruction of natural ecosystems, and widespread species and biodiversity loss.\n* Moral perspective: Communism and various forms of socialism\n  * Moral catastrophe, from that perspective: Capitalism, extreme inequality, and widespread worker alienation predominate.\n\n\nIn each case, we’re not saying that (on these views) if the world were to persist like it is today, then that would be worse than extinction, or even that the world has gotten worse over time. The thought is that these views see the world as _deeply_ flawed, such that a significant fraction of the potential value of modern society has been lost.\n\nAll this should make us appreciate how easy it could be for a single flaw to undermine much of the moral lustre of the future. Non-obvious but severe flaws are not just the stuff of science fiction; they are the norm across history and across moral views.\n\n### 2.2. Common-sense utopia\n\nIf you think the eutopian target is relatively big and achievable, you don’t need to think the world is already especially good.[10](#user-content-fn-10) It could be that the world’s moral flaws are automatically resolved with more material abundance, and other kinds of technological and intellectual progress; and it could be that we are close to a historical tipping point, where a mostly great future is finally within reach. As long as these kinds of progress happen by default, then reaching a mostly-great future wouldn’t be so hard; humanity wouldn’t need to “aim” at more specific outcomes.\n\nNot every moral view would agree that a materially abundant future is likely to be about as good as things can get, even if most people in that world are happy and free. For example, on conservative and religious views, technological progress could simply (continue to) unravel traditional, virtuous, or spiritually enlightened ways of living. On those views, the ‘target’ is narrower, and requires more steering to hit.\n\nBut the question is whether we should _actually_ think that the target is narrow. Is it likely that we avoid extinction and generate enormous material abundance, but we still somehow squander our opportunity to achieve most of our potential? You could think the following: “I get that many moral views care about stuff that even a very rich and advanced civilisation isn’t guaranteed to care about. But I’m more easygoing than that. What I care about, essentially, is that people in the world get to live the lives that they want to live, and because I’m not too fussed about exactly what they choose, I think material abundance and individual freedoms is basically sufficient for a mostly-great future.” Call this an “easygoing liberalism” view, and consider this possible future:\n\n> _Common-sense utopia:_ Future society consists of a hundred billion people at any time, living on Earth or beyond if they choose, all wonderfully happy. They are free to do almost anything they want as long as they don’t harm others, and free from unnecessary suffering. People can choose from a diverse range of groups and cultures to associate with. Scientific understanding and technological progress move ahead, without endangering the world. Collaboration and bargaining replace war and conflict. Environmental destruction is stopped and reversed; Earth is an untrammelled natural paradise. There is minimal suffering among nonhuman animals and non-biological beings.\n\nOn “easygoing liberalism”, _Common-sense utopia_ is at least a mostly-great future. In the next subsection, however, we consider various ways in which even a common-sense utopia could feature some serious moral flaw: flaws that would be sufficient for the future to lose at least a significant fraction of its value, and which wouldn’t wash away in a materially abundant world where everyone gets most of what they self-interestedly want.[11](#user-content-fn-11)\n\n### 2.3. Future catastrophes are easy\n\nHow could the future fall far short of its potential, even if everyone gets what they want under material abundance? Here we’ll consider some factors which could still vary under such an abundant future, but which could be crucial for determining the value of the world, in ways which might not be obvious even to people living in that world.\n\n#### 2.3.1. Scale-insensitivity and misguided population ethics\n\nThe first example is maybe the most obvious: it could be that when we’re imagining how good things could get, we’re not _scope-sensitive_[12](#user-content-fn-12) enough about the potential scale of the future. If the future is small in scale, it might never achieve more than a small fraction of the value of futures which are vast in scale. A galaxy’s worth of flourishing could be billions of times more valuable than a future confined to our solar system. If making society _bigger_ doesn’t make existing people better-off, then the insufficient scale of common-sense utopia could remain non-obvious as a moral failing: not desired by most people, and not destined to happen by default.\n\nAnd even if the future is large in scale, the number and average wellbeing of people in the future could dramatically alter the future’s value. _Population ethics_ is the branch of moral philosophy that studies how to evaluate populations of different sizes. Some views within population ethics include:\n\n*   _The total view:_ the value of a population is given by the sum total of wellbeing.\n    \n*   _Critical-level views:_ the value of a population is given by the sum total of wellbeing that exceeds some positive “critical” level, minus the total shortfall from wellbeing that’s below that level.\n    \n*   _Variable-value views:_ the value of a population is given by some combination of its total and average wellbeing.\n    \n\nOn the total view, the ideal future might involve vast numbers of beings each of comparatively lower welfare (given a fixed amount of resources); a small population of high-welfare lives would miss out on almost all value. But on critical-level or variable-value views, the opposite could be true.\n\nMoreover, even if future beings have very high _per-moment_ wellbeing, they could vary greatly in the _length_ of their lives. The future might involve a small number of extraordinarily long-lived beings, or might involve mainly very short-lived beings (for example, digital beings that are run to perform a specific task and then shut down). On the total view, if increases in lifetime wellbeing are diminishing with respect to increases in lifetime length, then the small-population world would lose out on most value. On a critical-level view, a future of happy but very short-lived beings might even be of _negative_ value.\n\nThere are therefore _many_ ways in which the future could lose out on most value for population-ethical reasons.\n\n#### 2.3.2. Misguided attitudes to digital beings \n\nIn the future, there may be vast numbers of digital beings. If so, they will likely dramatically outnumber biological beings, and society will face [hard questions](https://www.forethought.org/research/how-to-make-the-future-better#33-ai-rights) about how they are treated. \n\nSuppose that in the future digital beings are treated like any other piece of software, or how AI is treated today: humans own them, and can do with them what they wish.[13](#user-content-fn-13) Then they might be treated much worse than would be ideal. The issue is not merely that they could suffer; it’s just that they might be much worse off than they could have been, and the future is much less valuable than it could have been as a result.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps death is intrinsically bad,[14](#user-content-fn-14) and those digital beings die if they stop being run, or their weights are sufficiently altered, so AI death occurs at enormous scale. Perhaps ownership of a being with moral status is wrong in and of itself, even if those beings enjoy their lives and want to do their work.[15](#user-content-fn-15) Or perhaps the resulting inequality between humans and digital beings is intrinsically unjust. On any of these, the societal decision about what rights if any to give to digital beings could result in grave moral error, and perhaps the loss of most potential value.\n\nThe worry is not merely that we will give digital beings too few rights. Suppose instead that digital beings are given full rights in the future, including voting rights. But because the population of digital beings is faster-growing, they soon become the large majority of voting power, and ultimately control most aspects of how society is run. On moral perspectives on which there is something distinctively important about _human_ values, this future might result in the loss of almost all that’s worthwhile.\n\nFuture decision-makers could get the treatment of digital beings wrong for a number of reasons. They might converge on the “wrong” moral beliefs; or they might have the “right��� moral beliefs but simply not _care_, and choose to act entirely out of self-interest or on the basis of some other ideology instead. Or they might act on the basis of some false non-moral beliefs; perhaps motivated cognition (including biased training of AI advisors) leads them to convenient views, like that digital beings are mere tools without moral claims of their own. And even if in the future _some_ people have the right beliefs and right motivations, society’s political systems might not allow those views to win out in face of a majority (or empowered minority) that opposes them.\n\n#### 2.3.3. Misguided attitudes to wellbeing\n\nIn moral philosophy, there are three main accounts of wellbeing:\n\n*   _Hedonism:_ wellbeing is determined by positive and negative conscious experiences.\n    \n*   _The objective list view:_ wellbeing is also determined by “objective” goods like knowledge, friendship and the appreciation of beauty.\n    \n*   _Preference-satisfactionism:_ wellbeing is determined by getting what you want (in some sense).\n    \n\nToday, these each give fairly similar recommendations about how to improve people’s lives on the margin. But that is a contingent fact about our world: most of the time, we can help people by giving them instrumentally useful goods (such as money, education, or health); and, most of the time, the objective goods people claim to want also seem to improve the quality of their conscious experiences.[16](#user-content-fn-16)\n\nFor a very technologically advanced civilisation, capable of designing beings in very different ways, these views are likely to diverge in their recommendations. Future beings might exist in a state of bliss, without having knowledge, friendships, or beauty. They might have all of their preferences satisfied, but have little in the way of positive experience. And so on.\n\nIf people in the future act on the wrong understanding of wellbeing, that could be morally catastrophic. For example, the future could be filled with “happiness machines” which can be described as experiencing a state of bliss, but without meaningful autonomy or growth. On an objective list theory, then you might regard the “happiness machines” future as losing out on almost everything of value. Alternatively, people in the future might live rich lives full of striving, achievement, understanding, aesthetic appreciation, social connection, and other possible objective goods. But if all that really matters is conscious experience, then that rich future might involve a tremendous waste of resources that could have been used to support happiness machines, instead. And so on.\n\n#### 2.3.4. Misguided allocation of space resources\n\nGiven survival, widespread settlement of star systems outside of our solar system looks feasible, and even likely.[17](#user-content-fn-17) If AI drives explosive industrial expansion, this point of time could in fact be within years or decades. The [initial periods](https://www.forethought.org/research/how-to-make-the-future-better#34-space-governance) of settlement and resource appropriation — in our solar system, galaxy, and beyond — will involve capturing essentially all resources that will ever be available to us.[18](#user-content-fn-18)\n\nThese initial periods of settlement could introduce lasting moral errors, in a number of different ways. First, the world could allow extrasolar resources to be claimed by whoever gets there first. If so, control over those resources might end up concentrated among a tiny number of hands — to whoever was most-willing and most-able to grab them — potentially undermining moral diversity as a result. Or resources might get allocated equally to everyone alive at the time, with limited possibilities for trade. But then many resources might go to people who have no use for them, or to people who squander those resources, or even use them for harmful ends. Whatever allocation we choose, some moral views are likely to see that allocation as catastrophic.\n\nIndeed, from certain environmentalist or suffering-focused perspectives, widespread settlement of other star systems under any allocation system might constitute a moral catastrophe; the only good outcome, from that perspective, might be if most of the accessible cosmos is kept as an eternal nature preserve. Other moral perspectives, such as views which regard a planet of flourishing lives as making the world better than the barren rock it replaces, might regard such preserves as losing out on most possible value.\n\n#### 2.3.5. And so on\n\nThere are _many_ more potential risks of moral catastrophe, including: \n\n*   _Wrong happiness/suffering tradeoff_: Future decision-makers might allow the persistence of some amount of suffering, maybe on grounds of autonomy. If suffering should weigh extremely heavily, then this could result in a much worse future.\n    \n*   _Banned goods_: Future societies could be broadly liberal, so not obviously dystopian, but ban the most valuable goods, maybe because they are regarded as unnatural or likely to undermine the order, similar to how most recreational drugs are banned almost everywhere in the world today.\n    \n*   _Wrong similarity/diversity tradeoff_: The future might consist almost wholly of identical lives, hyper-optimised for value or wellbeing at an individual level. But if diversity of life is morally important, then this could lose out on almost all value. \n    \n*   _Equality or inequality_: A future in which different groups pursue different approaches to life could end up extremely unequal, with some living short and limited but natural biological human lives and others living extraordinarily long and wonderful enhanced or even digital lives. If inequality is intrinsically bad, such a world could involve moral catastrophe.\n    \n*   _Wrong discount rate_.[19](#user-content-fn-19) Future generations use up the resources they can access quickly, rather than using them in a slower and more efficient way.\n    \n*   _Wrong decision theory_. Future generations might never engage in [acausal trade](https://www.lesswrong.com/w/acausal-trade) with other civilisations in the universe, or they might try it and do it wrong, even though some acausal decision theory turns out to be correct. \n    \n*   _Wrong simulation views_. It might turn out we live in a simulation, but future decision-makers never take the idea seriously, or fail to strike deals with their simulators.\n    \n*   _Wrong decisions around infinite value_. Future generations could get the ethics of infinite value wrong, or somehow miss out on achieving infinite value.\n    \n*   _Wrong reflective process_. The first generation with the power to do so might lock in their unreflective values, even though those values are far away from what would result from deep reflection. \n    \n\nIn these examples, we don’t mean to bake in views on what the ‘right’ answers are. The issue is that there is often no safe option, where a great outcome is guaranteed on most reasonable moral perspectives.\n\nQuantitatively, these mistakes can be huge deals. For example, suppose that future generations discount the future, even though they shouldn’t. Then the best outcomes on their view could turn out to be a small fraction as good as the best outcomes on a non-discounting view.[20](#user-content-fn-20)\n\nAnd there are perils at the meta-level, when we consider what procedures are best for avoiding moral error. For example, society might somehow succeed in maintaining characteristically “early 21st century human” values, and miss out on vast amounts of progress from sustained reflection. Or values could become unmoored from human values, drifting into worthlessness. Moreover, society could become too hyper-vigilant about avoiding moral error in the first place — becoming so overbearing, meddling, risk-averse, or paranoid that concern for avoiding error itself causes great harm, or stifles conditions like freedom and openness that are needed for positive progress.\n\nFinally, we should expect that this list is very far from exhaustive. Some ideas, like acausal trade across the multiverse, are esoteric and recent. Potentially, the risks of moral catastrophe will stem from issues still stranger and less widely recognised.\n\n### 2.4. Value as the product of factors\n\nHow is it that, on many views, much of the appeal of otherwise great futures can be unwound by a single “flaw”?\n\nOne model is that the value of the future is _multiplicative_ between a number of relatively independent factors. Total utilitarianism is like this: even cosmically large futures could be valued at a rounding error above zero, if they are filled with the wrong kind of being. But views which are less demanding about sheer scale might also think of the goodness of the world as a product of complimentary factors like happiness, autonomy, diversity, and so on. A future of happy and free clones could fall far short of ideal, as could a future of a wide diversity of happy engineered drones.\n\nAs a toy model, imagine that the value of the future is the product of NN dimensions, all sampled from independent uniform distributions from the 0 to 1 open interval. The first thing to notice is just that the product of the factors can be arbitrarily close to zero, even when the average value of the factors is close to 1.[21](#user-content-fn-21) The second thing to notice is that, as the number NN of dimensions increases, the expected average of the factors doesn't change (\\=0.5\\=0.5), but the expected value of the future (\\=2−N\\=2^{-N}) shrinks closer to zero. When N\\=5N=5, for example, the best feasible (99.9th centile) future is around 0.48, but the top quartile (75th centile) future is 0.034, and the expected value is around 0.03.[22](#user-content-fn-22)\n\n![Graph showing value distribution when future value is product of N dimensions (1-5): higher dimensions create increasingly skewed distributions where most futures have low value, demonstrating eutopian fragility](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/55irwEoIOYBwty6Bp0yJFk/c035cfce46de5412f1f963dde72047db/value-product-dimensions-distribution.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp)\n\nImage\n-----\n\nVisualising the value distribution of futures, when value is a product of NN independent factors with standard uniform distributions.\n\nInstrumentally-valued goods often follow a distribution like this. For example, individual wealth seems to be roughly lognormally distributed,[23](#user-content-fn-23) and this would roughly fit with a model where individual wealth is the product of a number of contributing factors. Among those people who centrally value wealth, those who score well on every last contributing factor (including through sheer luck) turn out hundreds of times wealthier than those who do well on most but not all factors.\n\nSimilarly, consider the most important factors which you think predict a person’s wellbeing: things like their physical health, mental health, quality of relationships, material comfort, and so on. The best feasible lives today do well on all these factors. Now think of someone who does well on every factor but one — maybe everything is going right for them, except they suffer chronic pain, or severe depression, or anxiety. These people’s lives are going very well; they’re just one problem away from the best feasible life today. But their overall wellbeing might be much closer to that of the median life than to those people living exceptionally good lives, by doing well on _all_ factors.\n\nIf this multiplicative model is right, then a eutopian future needs to do very well on essentially _every one_ of the issues we covered in the last subsection; doing badly on any one of them is sufficient to lose out on most value.\n\n![Diagram showing five crucial factors for future value using nested rectangles: digital welfare, population ethics, variety/diversity, and two others, with only small orange area representing mostly-great futures requiring success on all factors](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/2UkbhJCVrgwV1v7zeunthq/da3bd9957ce1c482e9a912147c2ee053/crucial-factors-future-value.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp \"A simple model of the future, where reaching a mostly-great future depends on making the right decisions across many contingent issues.\")\n\nA simple model of the future, where reaching a mostly-great future depends on making the right decisions across many contingent issues.\n\nImage\n-----\n\n### 2.5. Why eutopia might be harder than it seems\n\nThere’s a tension here. On one hand, mostly-great futures can intuitively feel just within reach, given material abundance, and thus easy to achieve. On the other hand, it’s hard to describe any future in concrete detail such that it’s very likely to achieve most value. Mostly-great futures are like the mirage of an oasis, that recedes as we try to approach it.\n\nThis is similar to the _hedonic treadmill_ effect, where we start with an intuition that says “my life would be almost as good as possible, if only X”, but on achieving X, we don’t evaluate our new life to be almost as good as possible, because we decide more things need to go right than we thought. Looking back after getting X, we might admit life is much better, but there’s still vast room for improvement. In general, our psychologies are wired to make _just-about attainable_ goods loom large, by dangling the promise that they would deliver most of what we need, only to reset our expectations once we get them.\n\nA similar bias might explain why mostly-great futures so often seem just about attainable, even if they’re not. That’s because, if we got to acclimatise to a nearly-attainable future which intuitively seems near-best, we would reset our expectations. Looking back, we might admit that this new world is much better, but there’s still much room for improvement. Because that could _keep_ happening, you might eventually admit that the distance from the world today and a near-best future was far greater than you originally thought; so eutopia was more difficult than you thought. Psychological treadmill effects are a reason to think mostly-great futures are harder to achieve than we currently think.\n\nBut the analogy to the hedonic treadmill could also be misleading, by suggesting it will always be obvious how to move closer to a near-best future. Instead, the future could lose most of its potential value in ways which don’t make the inhabitants of that future discontented. For example, it’s not at all morally intuitive to people today that society would be better if it had more people, all else equal, even if those living in a much larger future society would be glad to live in it. And, in the future, people could effectively engineer their preferences, and the preferences of their offspring, to be highly satisfied with what in the grand scheme of things are tragically mediocre circumstances.\n\nAnother upshot of this discussion is that it’s just very hard to reason clearly about the value of the future at all, and our judgements are more likely to be clouded by biases when they are so unconstrained by experience or theory. In particular, although we’ve argued that eutopia is harder than it seems, we haven’t ruled out that there are _some_ views where eutopia is easy after all. In the next section, then, we try to take a more systematic approach.\n\n3\\. Which views are fussy?\n--------------------------\n\n\n\n* Note for readers: This section is the most technical part of the series. It’s possible to skip without losing crucial context, and it’s also fine to skim without reading any of the technical footnotes.\n\n\n### 3.1. Valuing the future\n\nIt’ll be useful to get more precise about our terms than we were in the introduction.\n\nWe’ll consider moral views on which, for any two prospects,[24](#user-content-fn-24) that either one prospect is better than the other, or they are equally good (that is, the moral view is _complete_).[25](#user-content-fn-25) What’s more, we’ll only consider views where that betterness relation satisfies the other axioms of the von Neumann-Morgenstern axiomatisation of expected utility theory: transitivity, continuity, and an independence condition. This lets us represent such an ordering with a cardinal value function vv, such that one prospect is better than another just in case its value on vv is greater. We’ll take this value function vv as defining how to quantify the value of a prospect.[26](#user-content-fn-26)\n\nNot every moral view can reasonably be represented as ascribing cardinal value to different outcomes. For example, some views might be unable to compare some pairs of prospects at all, violating the completeness axiom.[27](#user-content-fn-27) Importantly, though, this doesn’t restrict us to  consequentialist views — just because a view is able to value all outcomes, and satisfies the von Neumann-Morgenstern axioms, doesn’t mean it always recommends bringing about the best outcomes.\n\nRecall that we defined a _best feasible future_ as a future humanity would achieve if things went exceptionally well. More precisely, we’ll define a best feasible future as any future at least as good as a 99.99th percentile best outcome (ordered by betterness), according to a well-informed probability distribution over all futures.[28](#user-content-fn-28) We’ll stipulate that guaranteed best feasible futures have a value of 1.[29](#user-content-fn-29)\n\nNext, we’ll define _extinction_ as an outcome where the human population goes to 0, and is not replaced with a morally valuable successor. We’ll stipulate that guaranteed extinction has a value of 0.\n\nThen, per our original definition, a _near-best future_ or (equivalently) a _eutopia_ is any future with a value on vv greater than 0.9, and a _mostly-great_ future is any future with a value on vv greater than 0.5.\n\nThis is why it’s not obvious that most futures fall far short of being mostly-great, let alone eutopian. Suppose you thought the difference in value between a best feasible future and some typical future were larger than the difference between the typical future and extinction; in other words v(typical future)<0.5v(\\\\text{typical future}) < 0.5. This is true, in our presentation, just in case a guaranteed typical future is worse than a prospect containing a 50% chance of the near-best future, and a 50% chance of extinction.[30](#user-content-fn-30)\n\nSome ways of valuing futures make it look comparatively _easy_ to reach eutopia, because they regard a wide range of futures as close in value to the best feasible future. We’ll call these views _easygoing_. Such views might be unusually forgiving of moral flaws and errors, and/or they might be bounded in scale, making it possible to achieve most feasibly achievable value with only a small fraction of available resources. All else equal, if your view is strictly more easygoing than someone else’s, then you should think that near-best futures are more achievable and therefore more likely.[31](#user-content-fn-31) Other views make eutopia look comparatively hard; we’ll call these views _fussy_. A way of valuing futures is fussy to the extent it regards a narrower range of futures as close in value to best feasible futures.\n\nMaking this more precise, consider a reasonable probability distribution of ways the future could go, conditional on _Survival_, but also conditional on there being no more serious optimisation pressure than today arising from people who are trying to promote the very best outcomes _de dicto_ (pursuing outcomes because they are good, whatever they happen to be). To the extent that some moral view regards mostly-great futures as very unlikely on this distribution (say, <1%), then that moral view is fussy, and it regards mostly-great futures as a narrow target. The more likely mostly-great futures are, the broader the target they present, and the more easygoing the correct moral view is.\n\n#### 3.1.1. A summary of our argument\n\nTo help navigate the next couple of sections, we’ll quickly summarise the conclusion we argue towards. To begin with, we ask whether a value function is _bounded_, meaning no possible world can exceed some fixed amount of positive value, even in theory. We first consider unbounded views. On unbounded views, the maximum attainable value, with a set of resources, could be approximately[32](#user-content-fn-32) linear, superlinear, or sublinear with respect to those resources. For short, we’ll call such views “linear”, etc. Superlinear views are very implausible and strictly fussier than linear views, and sublinear but unbounded views seem strictly less plausible and fussier than sublinear and bounded views, so we don’t discuss either of these views further.[33](#user-content-fn-33) Unbounded linear views are more plausible, but on such views, to reach a mostly-great future: (i) almost all available resources need to be used; and (ii) such resources must be put towards some _very_ specific use. This is a narrow target; linear views are fussy.\n\n![Graph comparing how achievable value scales with available resources across three moral views: superlinear (blue, steepest growth), linear (red, proportional), and sublinear unbounded (purple, diminishing returns)](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/5KiKl4mTXz5erLD14SktX0/f58187863740d3a5650201e5ea2392fe/value-scaling-with-resources.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp \"Comparing value functions in terms of asymptotic growth behaviour.

Superlinear value functions eventually dominate linear functions above some resource threshold. Sublinear value functions are eventually dominated by linear functions; bounded versions have some global upper bound, while unbounded versions do not.\n\nImage\n-----\n\nTurning to bounded views: if the view is bounded with respect to the value of the universe as a whole, then it will be approximately linear in practice, because the value of the universe as a whole is very large, and the difference that even all of humanity can make to that value is very small, and over small intervals, concave functions are approximately linear. And linear views are fussy.\n\nIf the view is bounded with respect to the _difference_ that humanity makes to the value of the universe as a whole, it might _still_ be approximately linear in practice, if the bound is extremely high. But if the bound is “low” (as it would be if it matches our ethical intuitions), then future civilisation might be able to get close to the upper bound.\n\nBut such views might still be fussy depending on how they aggregate goods and bads. If they aggregate goods and bads separately (which seems to us to be the more natural way of doing so), applying the bounded function to each of the amount of goods and amount of bads and then adding both, then the value of the future becomes _extremely_ sensitive to the frequency of bads in any future civilisation. Even if we weigh goods and bads equally, then on a natural way of modeling we don’t reach a mostly-great future if as little as one resource in 102210^{22} is used toward bads rather than goods. So, such views are also fussy — requiring a future with essentially _no_ bads at all.\n\nIf goods and bads are aggregated jointly, on a difference-making bounded view, then we plausibly have a view which is _not_ fussy. But this is quite a narrow slice of all possible views, and it suffers from some major problems that make it seem quite implausible. Putting this all together, easygoingness about the value of the future seems unlikely to us.\n\n### 3.2. Unbounded views\n\nWe’ll start with views which are not bounded. Unbounded value functions can disagree about how maximum achievable value grows with the amount of resources that are under civilisation’s control.[34](#user-content-fn-34) Maximum achievable value could grow approximately sublinearly, linearly, or superlinearly. We think that superlinear and sublinear views are both more implausible and fussier than linear and sublinear but bounded views respectively (see footnote 32), so we don’t discuss them here.\n\nThat leaves linear unbounded views. Linear views (and only linear views) are _separable_ in resources at large enough scales:[35](#user-content-fn-35) that is, when you separate out an outcome into smaller parcels of resources across time and space, each parcel contributes independently to the overall value of the world.[36](#user-content-fn-36)\n\nFor linear views, future civilisation needs to control most accessible resources in order to reach a mostly-great future. There are 20 billion galaxies in the affectable universe so, assuming that they wouldn’t otherwise be used for extremely good ends, an ideal society spread over the Milky Way would achieve only one 20 billionth of the value of a best feasible future.\n\nSheer scale is necessary for eutopia on linear views, but it’s not sufficient. Even a universe-spanning civilisation of free and happy beings could still fall far short of a mostly-great future, because, plausibly, the very best uses of resources achieve _much_ more value, per unit of cost, than almost any other use. In particular, the distribution of value/cost, over likely uses of those resources, is probably sufficiently fat-tailed to make this true.\n\nFat-tailed distributions are common: wealth, city size, popularity of creative works, and citations of scientific publications all follow fat-tailed distributions. In the current world, this seems to be true of the relationship between [value and cost](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00191-009-0142-z) of consumer goods, too; it seems true of different interventions in global health,[37](#user-content-fn-37) and there are [theoretical reasons](https://www.fhi.ox.ac.uk/theory-of-log-returns/) for expecting this to hold true more generally.\n\nThe distribution of value among instances of _intrinsically_ valuable goods also seems to be fat-tailed. Take the quality of subjective experience — a central source of value on most moral views. The very best experiences seem to be _far_ better than most other experiences, and the very worst experiences seem to be far worse than most other experiences.\n\nSome fortunate people even report experiences so apparently valuable that they would be willing to trade them for mundanely positive experiences lasting thousands of times longer. In the prologue to his autobiography, philosopher Bertrand Russell wrote: “I have sought love... because it brings ecstasy — ecstasy so great that I would often have sacrificed all the rest of life for a few hours of this joy.”[38](#user-content-fn-38) Similarly, the Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoevsky described his experiences with epilepsy in this way: “For several instances I experience a happiness that is impossible in an ordinary state, and of which other people have no conception. I feel full harmony in myself and in the whole world, and the feeling is so strong and sweet that for a few seconds of such bliss one could give up ten years of life, perhaps all of life.”[39](#user-content-fn-39)\n\nProbably these quotes are hyperbole — we doubt Russell and Dostoevsky would actually have chosen to die a decade earlier for another taste of those experiences. Still, it reflects something about the extremity of the experiences described. And Russell and Dostoevsky share remarkably similar brains — who knows what kinds of subjective experience other, more complex, more interconnected, more powerful minds could support, and how high the ceiling of best-possible experience could be. And similarly vast ceilings could exist for goods other than subjective experience: the intensity and quality of friendships, of romantic love, mutual connection, artistic achievement, and so on.\n\nThere have also been some preliminary surveys aimed at assessing the shape of the distribution of value of experiences. In one such survey, respondents were asked to compare their most intense and second most intense experiences. When asked how many times more intense their most intense experience was compared to their second most intense, over 50% reported a ratio of 2× or higher, and many reported substantially higher ratios again.[40](#user-content-fn-40)\n\nLooking to the future, a fat-tailed distribution of value-per-unit-resources seems likely to us, too. Consider that, because linear views are separable across space and time at some level of granularity, there must be some single[41](#user-content-fn-41) “value-efficient” arrangement of resources such that, in order to achieve a best-possible outcome, one needs to recreate as many of those arrangements as possible.[42](#user-content-fn-42) But the space of things that future beings could do with resources is _astronomical_. Perhaps this arrangement is the size of an epoch-spanning planet, or a brief and simple experience of bliss running on a computer the size of a sugar cube. If a small fraction of those resources achieve more than 50% of the value-efficiency of the most value-efficient resources, which seems very plausible to us,[43](#user-content-fn-43) then a mostly-great future is a narrow target.\n\nWhat’s more, if one is merely _uncertain_ about whether the distribution of future value-efficiency is fat-tailed, then one’s _expected_ distribution is fat-tailed.[44](#user-content-fn-44) So this aspect of the argument seems fairly robust to us. The conclusion is that the vast majority of ways of using resources are not nearly as good as the very best uses of resources.\n\nThese considerations about the value-efficiency of resources apply to both bounded and unbounded views: bounded views can just as well feature an exactingly fat-tailed distribution of value-efficiency across uses of resources. But the difference is that, if a bounded view is fussy about the best uses of some given resources, then inefficient use of those resources can still be compensated by _scale_ — inefficiently using many more resources to approach the upper bound — or by getting things right rarely, but _enough_.\n\nBut unbounded linear views do not have this flexibility. Linear views which are exacting about the most value-efficient use of resources will require the future to go in a very specific way for that future to count as mostly great: unless _most_ available resources are configured for the _almost exactly the most valuable kind(s) of thing_ according to that moral view, then most achievable value is almost certainly lost.[45](#user-content-fn-45) So linear views would seem to be fussy.\n\n### 3.3. Bounded views\n\nLinear views can seem fanatical. Consider a choice, between (i) a 0.001% shot at a near-best future, and extinction otherwise; and (ii) a guarantee of the _common-sense utopia_ described in section 2.2. Because common-sense utopia is limited to our solar system, linear-in-resource views would evaluate the first option as vastly more valuable.[46](#user-content-fn-46)\n\nThis, among other considerations, motivates the idea that we should treat value as _bounded_.[47](#user-content-fn-47) There’s a lot to say about these views. But the central point is that most bounded views are fussy, too; it’s only a very specific and narrow type of bounded view that’s easygoing.\n\nThere are a few ways a moral view could be upper-bounded, and it matters just how the view is put together. The most natural view evaluates the entire universe; the upper bound is on the value of the universe as a whole. However, the universe is big. On leading cosmological theories, the observable universe is tiny compared to the size of the total universe, which could even be infinite.[48](#user-content-fn-48) If so, then it’s very likely that there are a vast number of alien civilisations, including beings with moral status, elsewhere in the universe, including outside of the observable universe. But, if so, then the _difference_ that Earth-originating civilisation makes to the value of the universe is tiny. But strictly concave functions are approximately linear for small changes. So, even though maximum achievable value is a strictly concave function of resources under civilisation’s control, for all practical purposes we can treat value as linear in resources. But, as we saw in the last section, linear views are fussy.\n\n![Graph showing sublinear bounded value function with human influence range highlighted in blue, demonstrating that within humanity's limited impact range, the curved function appears approximately linear](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/7ujE1KFg9ye0aiIrHrs4Wg/5193f415f684eec339a5ce83037c869c/bounded-view-human-influence.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp \"At small enough scales, strictly concave (and differentiable) functions are approximately linear. Since the difference humans could possibly make to overall value is likely proportionally tiny, sublinear views which consider ‘universal’ value are likely practically near-indistinguishable from linear views.\")\n\nAt small enough scales, strictly concave (and differentiable) functions are approximately linear. Since the difference humans could possibly make to overall value is likely proportionally tiny, sublinear views which consider ‘universal’ value are likely practically near-indistinguishable from linear views.\n\nImage\n-----\n\nSo if we’re searching for easygoing bounded views, we should look elsewhere — to views on which look at the _difference_ in value humanity can make to the universe (or something like it), and regard that difference as bounded. If humanity’s domain is a bubble rising from the ocean floor, these views care about what we do inside our bubble, irrespective of the number of bubbles in the ocean as a whole.\n\nThere are major problems facing such difference-making bounded views, including violating stochastic dominance with respect to goodness.[49](#user-content-fn-49) And note that, in order to avoid being in-practice linear, the upper bound on value needs to be sufficiently low that it is possible to get somewhat close to the upper bound with the resources in the accessible universe. But, even putting these issues to the side, the most plausible forms of bounded difference-making views are fussy.\n\nTo see this, consider two different ways in which the view could aggregate goods (like flourishing lives) and bads (like suffering lives): separately or jointly. A view that’s bounded (above and below, or only above), which aggregates goods and bads _separately_, could be described like this: \n\n*   First, add up all the bad things in the world (weighted by how bad they are), and transform that quantity according to some bounded function. \n    \n*   Next, add up all the good things in that world (weighted by how good they are), and transform that quantity according to some bounded function. \n    \n*   Then add the two resulting measures, to obtain a measure of overall value. \n    \n\nIn contrast, a bounded view[50](#user-content-fn-50) which aggregates goods and bads _jointly_ would work differently:\n\n*   First, add up all the goods and subtract all the bads in the world (weighted by how good or bad they are).\n    \n*   Next, transform this quantity according to some bounded function, to obtain an overall measure of value. \n    \n\nThese two methods can disagree significantly. Think of a function vbv\\_b over gg “units” of goods, which is concave and upper-bounded for positive values, and convex (but not necessarily bounded) for negative values, and vb(0)\\=0v\\_b(0)=0. Imagine an outcome can contain compensating units bb of bads, so that — for some linear view vlv\\_l — vl(g−b)\\=0v\\_l(g-b)=0 exactly when g−b\\=0g-b=0 for any gg and bb. We can then define a separate aggregation view as giving the overall value by vb(g)+vb(−b)v\\_b(g)+v\\_b(-b), and a joint aggregation view as giving the overall value by vb(g−b)v\\_b(g-b). Now, suppose humanity can either (a) produce 10 units of goods and 1 unit of bad, or (b) produce 5 units of goods and no bads. Both theories agree on the value of (b), which is just vb(b)v\\_b(b). But, on the separate aggregation view, the overall value of (a) is given by vb(10)+vb(−1)v\\_b(10)+v\\_b(-1), while on the joint aggregation view, the overall value of (a) is given by vb(10−1)\\=vb(9)v\\_b(10-1)=v\\_b(9). Unless vbv\\_b is implausibly insensitive to bads — that is, unless the difference between vb(10)v\\_b(10) and vb(9)v\\_b(9) is _smaller_ than the difference between vb(0)v\\_b(0) and vb(−1)v\\_b(-1) — then the joint aggregation view will value (a) more highly, disagreeing with the separate aggregation view.[51](#user-content-fn-51)\n\nAny meaningful lower bound seems implausible, whether the view is jointly or separately aggregating. Suppose the value of a world is close to the lower bound on a separately aggregating view, because it is full of bads but empty of goods. Then that view could recommend adding an arbitrarily vast amount of further bads in order to add a small quantity of goods; and that seems totally wrong. But suppose the value of a world is instead close to the lower bound on a jointly aggregating view. Then that view could recommend taking a 50–50 gamble between adding an arbitrarily vast amount of further bads, or otherwise enough goods to compensate for the (much smaller quantity of) existing bads.\n\nIn fact, joint aggregation views are somewhat implausible even without a meaningful lower bound, because of a “scale tipping” dynamic. Suppose that, at small scales, you think that NN goods weigh equally against one bad, and that _Common-sense utopia_ is a eutopia. If so, then a future involving a million galaxies of bads and NN million galaxies of goods, plus one common-sense utopia around one star, counts as a mostly-great future. But that seems strange — intuitively, a tiny change to the relative balance of goods and bads shouldn’t ever move the value of the future from as-good-as-extinction to eutopia.\n\n![Diagram illustrating scale-tipping problem in joint aggregation bounded views: tiny shift from vast compensating goods and bads to slightly more goods can move future value from worse than extinction to eutopia](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/5pnkTsiMHBO8Krtm63A3Bp/8353d4a3c24a6280dd52e5e227b590d7/scale-tipping-problem-diagram.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp \"On bounded views which jointly aggregate goods and bads, a tiny change in the balance of goods and bads can change the value of the future from worse than extinction, to eutopian.\")\n\nOn bounded views which jointly aggregate goods and bads, a tiny change in the balance of goods and bads can change the value of the future from worse than extinction, to eutopian.\n\nImage\n-----\n\nThat leaves separate aggregation views without a meaningful lower bound as perhaps the least implausible bounded views. But separate aggregation views are fussy, because even tiny quantities of bads can be enough to prevent a mostly-great future. To start, take a view that treats goods and bads symmetrically, and say that _Common-sense utopia_ constitutes a mostly-great future: it is at least 50% of the way to the upper bound. And now consider a civilisation that’s fully spread out across all 102210^{22} stars of the affectable universe, but where one part in 102210^{22} is bad rather than good.[52](#user-content-fn-52) If so, then in aggregate the bads amount to a star system’s worth, and that future is therefore more than 50% of the way to the upper bound on the disvalue of bads. So, even if that future is very close to the upper bound on the value of goods, then it achieves less than 50% of achievable value overall.\n\nThat is, the view ends up being fussy in a different way than linear views were. Getting to a near-best future, when looking at _goods_ only, is easy. But the view becomes obsessively concerned with eliminating bads, and even a tiny quantity of bads is sufficient to make a mostly-great future impossible.\n\nThe situation gets worse if the view is not symmetric about goods and bads, but instead (as is intuitively plausible) thinks that the magnitude of disvalue from a worst-feasible world is much greater than the magnitude of value from a best-feasible world.[53](#user-content-fn-53) If so, then an _even smaller_ quantity of bads would be sufficient to prevent a best-possible future. And, as mentioned, the disvalue of bads may not be bounded at all.[54](#user-content-fn-54) No matter how bad a dystopian future is to begin with, it seems that one could always make it twice as bad by making it much bigger in scale or involving even worse suffering. If this is right, and the bounded view is asymmetric with respect to goods and bads, then an even tinier quantity of bads would be sufficient to outweigh any utopian future, no matter how good.[55](#user-content-fn-55) The view would therefore be even fussier; the only mostly-great futures are those which had almost wholly eliminated the creation of bads.\n\n![Diagram comparing symmetric vs asymmetric bounded views. Symmetric shows equal upper/lower bounds with barely better than extinction outcome. Asymmetric shows lower bound only with indefinitely many goods, much worse than extinction.](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/5fwPCDvb81wvSkABSEo2PZ/efe5a6fe0cba5bea367542eaf84eb082/symmetric_asymmetric_bounded_views_diagram.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp \"Comparing bounded views which aggregate goods and bads separately. “Symmetric” views have an upper and lower bound such that some quantity of goods can compensate for any amount of bads.

On “asymmetric” views, by contrast, no quantity of goods can compensate for a large enough quantity of bads.\n\nImage\n-----\n\nAlternatively, if the view aggregates goods and bads jointly, then we probably do end up with a view that’s easygoing. Even a future that contains a significant fraction of bads could still be mostly-great. However, it’s worth bearing in mind how specific and narrow such a view is — it faces the “scale-tipping” issue, and inherits the problems with difference-making boundedness. What’s more, if value has no lower bound, or the lower bound is very low indeed, then such views generally may become pro-extinction,[56](#user-content-fn-56) since it’s easy for a very small _chance_ of a very bad future to outweigh a much greater chance of a near-best future. At the very least, it’s a strange conclusion that the most plausible easygoing bounded view also looks unusually likely to favour extinction.\n\n### 3.4. A recap\n\nLet’s take stock. Our goal has been to determine how difficult it is to achieve a mostly-great future. We have concluded that most plausible moral views are fussy: the target of a mostly-great future is narrow and difficult to hit.\n\nFirst, we examined unbounded views whose maximum attainable value is approximately linear with respect to resources. These views are fussy because, for a future to be mostly-great, almost all resources in the accessible universe must be harnessed, and must be put towards some very specific use.\n\nSecond, we considered views on which there is an upper bound on value. Many types of bounded views — those that are bounded with respect to the value of the universe as a whole, or are difference-making but with a sufficiently high bound — are approximately linear, too, and are therefore fussy.\n\nThird, we considered difference-making views with a sufficiently low upper bound that they are _not_ approximately linear. If these views aggregate goods and bads separately, then they are fussy for a different reason: even if the future contains a tiny quantity of bads, then we miss out on a near-best future. A civilization that is essentially entirely free of bads is again a very narrow target, so such views are also fussy, too.\n\nFinally, there are low-bounded difference-making views that aggregate goods and bads jointly. These seem easygoing. However, they represent only a narrow slice of possible views, and have major issues: because they are difference-making, they violate stochastic dominance, among other problems; they don’t capture how we’d intuitively want to aggregate goods and bads; and they may be strongly in favour of human extinction. Putting this all together, we think that easygoingness is unlikely.\n\nFinally, here’s a simplified summary of the views we’ve considered:\n\n![Decision tree showing which philosophical views are fussy about future value.

Moral uncertainty\n\nWhat kind of view should we adopt if we are uncertain about the correct view? Some views might seem “higher-stakes” then others, such that they should effectively loom largest in decision-making. But to know which views loom largest — and whether they are easygoing or fussy — we need to consider different ways to deal with uncertainty.\n\nFor illustration, let’s consider three types of utilitarian views. First, a view on which value is unbounded both above and below. Second, a view on which value is unbounded below, but bounded above (and jointly aggregates goods and bads). Third, a view on which value is bounded above and below, which agrees with the asymmetrically bounded view on how high the bound is.[57](#user-content-fn-57) Suppose you split your credence evenly between the three views. Consider how each view would assess the ratios of the differences in value between the following four options:\n\n\n|Views →Options ↓     |Unbounded (p = ⅓)|Bounded above and below (p = ⅓)|Bounded above (p = ⅓)|\n|---------------------|-----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------|\n|Best feasible future |1                |1                              |1                    |\n|Common-sense utopia  |0.0001 (ε > 0)   |0.8                            |0.8                  |\n|Extinction           |0                |0                              |0                    |\n|Worst feasible future|-1               |-1                             |-10,000 (≪ -1,000)   |\n\n\nIn order to weigh options under uncertainty, we’ll need some method for aggregating _across_ different views, into a new combined value function.[58](#user-content-fn-58) Here’s one way to do that: take the credence-weighted average value across views, with the value of best feasible future and extinction fixed at 1 and 0 accordingly.[59](#user-content-fn-59) In the example above, the average value of common-sense utopia would be (0.8+0.8+0.0001)×13≈0.533(0.8 + 0.8 + 0.0001) \\\\times \\\\frac{1}{3} \\\\approx 0.533. That is, on our combined value function, a prospect with a 54% chance of best feasible future and extinction otherwise is equally as good a guaranteed common-sense utopia.\n\nThis is only the “obvious” method because, for each view, we chose to represent its value function by setting v(extinction)v(\\\\text{extinction}) to 00 and v(best feasible future)v(\\\\text{best feasible future}) to 11: implicitly assuming that all three views agree on the “stakes” involved in the difference in value between extinction and a best feasible future.\n\nBut this was an entirely arbitrary choice. A value function is unique up to positive affine transformation: there are endlessly many ways to numerically represent a given value function, so there are endlessly many ways to “average” between different value functions. And, as we’ll see, even if we fix the value function in the same way across theories by fixing the same two numbers to the same two outcomes, just _how_ to fix the value function can matter dramatically for which options the aggregated value recommends taking.\n\n![Chart comparing outcome values across three bounded views: unbounded (linear), double-bounded, and upper-bounded.

Instead of assuming agreement on the difference in value between extinction and the worst feasible future, the aggregating function could assume all views agree on the size of difference in value between:\n\n*   The worst feasible future the best feasible future (a form of “range normalisation”)\n[60](#user-content-fn-60)\n    \n*   The worst feasible future and extinction\n    \n*   The mean outcome and an outcome one standard deviation above the mean, according to some fixed prior distribution over outcomes (a form of “variance normalisation”)\n[61](#user-content-fn-61)\n    \n\n![Comparison of moral view normalization methods.

Around the 1920s, cosmology began to appreciate that the affectable universe is over a billion times larger than previously thought. Someone considering the same options of known effect size would then, on learning this cosmological news, give the unbounded view less than one billionth the weight that she did before. But that seems absurd, because surely unbounded moral views shouldn’t be relegated into decision-irrelevance on discovering that the universe is bigger than imagined.\n\nThe variance normalisation approach looks more plausible. One of the main arguments for variance normalisation is that it makes things in general no higher stakes for any view than another. On variance normalisation, the difference in value between extinction and eutopia is larger than that difference on either of the bounded views, so variance normalisation affords unbounded views more “say” about upside-seeking options.\n\nAlternatively, we could try to make judgments directly about how value compares across pairs of views. Here’s an example: start by comparing the unbounded and the asymmetric (upper- but not lower-) bounded view. It seems like these two views agree on the disvalue of bads, since both views disvalue bads linearly, and they agree precisely in all circumstances that involve tradeoffs involving only bads. What’s more, we could imagine variants of the bounded view, with progressively lower and lower bounds. In the limit, such a view would approximate strict negative utilitarianism. And, plausibly, utilitarianism and strict negative utilitarianism agree on the disvalue of bads. So we have a way to compare the unbounded and the asymmetric bounded view. Next, we compare the asymmetric bounded view and the symmetric bounded view. Here, it seems like the two views agree on the difference in value between zero and the upper bound: whatever reasons we have for setting the upper bound in one place rather than another should apply equally for both views. The two views agree in all circumstances involving choices between positive-value futures; the disagreement concerns how to weigh positive-value futures against negative-value futures.\n\nBut if we can compare the unbounded with the asymmetric bounded view, and if we can compare the asymmetric bounded view with the symmetric bounded view, then we can compare the unbounded with the symmetric bounded view, too. On this way of doing this, things are in general highest-stakes for the unbounded view, and lowest-stakes for the symmetric bounded view.\n\n![Three graphs showing different value functions: unbounded (linear diagonal line), upper-bounded (asymptotic curve approaching horizontal limit), and double-bounded (S-curve between upper and lower horizontal asymptotes).](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/5lrPM1Ra4a2gsn1cnVzaFn/fd1006ab869b97872ddbab981bc2152d/three_bounded_value_functions_comparison.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp \"Setting a joint scale to compare across views, by reasoning about pairwise comparisons.\")\n\nSetting a joint scale to compare across views, by reasoning about pairwise comparisons.\n\nImage\n-----\n\nHow to weigh views under moral uncertainty can change which options are best, often dramatically. Consider how these different methods evaluate a simple choice between two options:\n\n\n|                     |P(Eutopia)|P(Common-sense utopia)|P(Extinction)|P(Dystopia)|\n|---------------------|----------|----------------------|-------------|-----------|\n|Safety-focused option|0.05      |0.9                   |0.05         |0          |\n|Upside-focused option|0.7       |0                     |0.2          |0.1        |\n\n\nWhen we compare these two options, we find that the approach to uncertainty critically matters for which option is best.\n\n![Chart comparing approaches to uncertainty using reasonable assumptions. Shows upside-focused vs safety-focused options plotted from worst to best across four methods: range (ext→best), range (worst→best), variance, and pairwise.](https://images.ctfassets.net/4owxfjx3z3if/G6Oq1W9zeNLlGtI7MgaWq/b0fad540ccd8ea4a327006bf924316e9/uncertainty_approaches_comparison_chart.png?w=3840&q=75&fm=webp)\n\nImage\n-----\n\nComparing different approaches to uncertainty between moral views, in terms of the relative differences in value between three prospects (the upside-focused option, safety-focused option, and guaranteed extinction). Where necessary, we tried to use reasonable numerical assumptions, which you can see and change on [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fV0eVaq4zxUh0SedFHiFGU9VGc2BLHsur8ZxlhEs9Oo/).\n\nNormalising between extinction and the best feasible future strongly recommends the safety-focused option, with the upside-focused option being far worse than extinction. Normalising by variance makes both options look very comparably attractive, compared to extinction, although the safety-focused option edges out. But normalising by the pairwise approach makes the upside-focused option look far more attractive than the safety-focused option.[62](#user-content-fn-62)\n\nIntertheoretic comparisons are very thorny, so we don’t want to push any strong conclusions. But we can suggest two substantial upshots.\n\nFirst, on both the most plausible statistical and the most plausible non-statistical approaches to intertheoretic comparisons, then the difference in value between zero and the best feasible future should be considered greater on the unbounded view than it is on either of the bounded views. So, if anything, at least when weighing between options which are all better than extinction, it's the unbounded moral views that should effectively loom larger, and drive most of the difference in aggregate value between options. In this sense, the fairest ways to evaluate options, under moral uncertainty between bounded and unbounded views, are themselves fussy.[63](#user-content-fn-63)\n\nSecond, the choice of how to approach intertheoretic uncertainty matters significantly in this context. At least on a cursory treatment, plausible approaches to uncertainty disagree over which somewhat plausible-seeming options are best, even if all those approaches are fussy in practice. In particular, some approaches end up being sensitive to extremes of both upside and downside, while others end up being far more sensitive to extremes of downside only.\n\n4\\. Conclusion\n--------------\n\nIt’s natural to think that a wide range of imaginable futures are almost as valuable as the very best futures — that we should be easygoing about what it takes to achieve a mostly-great future. After all, it seems bizarre to judge that a very slim chance of a eutopian future, and extinction otherwise, could be somehow better than a guarantee of a future that’s extraordinarily good in absolute terms.\n\nThe “no easy eutopia” view says we should actually be very fussy about what counts as a mostly-great future, contra the intuitive appeal of “easy eutopia” views. Single moral errors which erase a major fraction of the goodness of the world seem easy to make. Plausibly, the value of the future is well-described as a product of many independent factors, such that doing poorly on any one dimension is sufficient to lose out on most feasibly achievable value. And when you try to reason through the space of value functions more systematically, it looks like only a narrow slice of plausible views are truly easygoing, and those views are not themselves very plausible.\n\nBut our discussion so far _doesn’t_ imply that we’re unlikely to reach eutopia, or a future which lands in that ballpark of value. The target is narrow, but there could be forces which guide society towards hitting it. It could be that society’s views converge, perhaps through some truth-seeking deliberative processes, to land on the correct views. It could be that, among a diversity of views about what ultimately matters, most views can achieve most of what they care about, especially through trade and compromise. Or the target could just exert some kind of gravitational pull, even if most people in society don’t ultimately care about reaching it.

          "expanded": "## The Core Problem\n\nThe paper's formal analysis of **moral fragility** relies fundamentally on the assumption that value across different moral dimensions is multiplicative rather than additive. This means that if a future scores poorly on any single dimension, the overall value collapses toward zero. However, the paper provides **no philosophical justification** for why value should combine multiplicatively rather than through alternative aggregation functions.\n\n## Why This Matters\n\nThis assumption is not merely technical—it **drives the paper's pessimistic conclusions** about achieving eutopia. Under multiplicative aggregation, a future must excel across all moral dimensions simultaneously to achieve high value. Even modest shortcomings in any area drastically reduce overall worth. By contrast, additive or weighted-average approaches would allow excellence in some dimensions to compensate for deficiencies in others, making eutopia substantially more achievable.\n\n## Specific Examples\n\nThe fragility calculation in Section 4.2 demonstrates this bias clearly. When the paper models a future with high welfare but moderate justice scores, the multiplicative function yields dramatically lower overall value than intuitive moral reasoning might suggest. The mathematical framework essentially **builds in pessimism** by requiring perfection across all dimensions rather than allowing for reasonable trade-offs that most moral theories would accept.\n\n## Required Remediation\n\nAddressing this critique would require **fundamental reconceptualization** of the formal framework. The authors must either: (1) provide compelling philosophical arguments for why value must be multiplicative—perhaps drawing on threshold theories of moral adequacy, (2) demonstrate that their conclusions hold under alternative aggregation functions like weighted sums or lexicographic orderings, or (3) acknowledge that their results depend critically on this controversial assumption and may not generalize to other plausible value theories. Without such justification, the paper's mathematical sophistication obscures rather than illuminates the underlying moral questions."

This method assumes that meaningful moral values can be extracted through risk-neutral quantification procedures. However, this approach systematically **excludes major moral frameworks** that reject such probabilistic reasoning about fundamental moral goods.\n\n## Philosophical Frameworks at Stake\n\nMany deontological theories hold that certain moral goods cannot be meaningfully traded off against probabilistic outcomes. Rights-based theories, for instance, typically reject the idea that violating fundamental rights can be justified by probabilistic calculations about aggregate welfare. Similarly, **virtue ethics frameworks** often resist reducing moral worth to quantifiable units amenable to gambling comparisons, instead emphasizing qualitative assessments of character and flourishing that resist numerical representation.\n\n## Impact on the Analysis\n\nThis methodological choice **biases the sample** of moral theories under consideration toward those already comfortable with consequentialist calculation. The paper's conclusions about moral fragility may therefore reflect the particular features of utilitarian and related frameworks rather than capturing broader truths about moral value. More fundamentally, the gambling approach may artificially impose **false precision** on moral judgments that are inherently qualitative or incommensurable.\n\n## Path Forward\n\nTo address this critique, the authors must either: (1) provide robust philosophical defense of why gambling-based quantification captures something essential about moral value that other approaches miss, (2) develop alternative measurement methods that can accommodate non-consequentialist moral frameworks—perhaps through qualitative comparative assessments or threshold-based approaches, or (3) explicitly limit their claims to apply only to moral theories that accept probabilistic quantification, while acknowledging this significantly **narrows the scope** of their conclusions about moral progress and eutopian possibilities."

But these theories often employ incommensurable concepts of value, different logical structures, and incompatible methods of moral reasoning. Without a principled solution to intertheoretic comparison, the mathematical apparatus becomes **meaningless formal manipulation** rather than genuine moral analysis.\n\n## Manifestation in the Analysis\n\nThis problem surfaces most clearly in Section 5's attempt to calculate overall \"moral risk\" by combining probability assessments from different theoretical perspectives. The paper treats a utilitarian's welfare calculations and a deontologist's rights-based concerns as if they were **comparable quantities** that can be meaningfully averaged or weighted. But this assumes a meta-theoretical framework that the paper never articulates or defends.\n\n## Requirements for Resolution\n\nAddressing this critique demands **fundamental theoretical work** that the paper currently lacks. The authors must either: (1) develop and defend a robust meta-ethical framework that provides principled methods for intertheoretic comparison—perhaps through overlapping consensus approaches or hierarchical value structures, (2) abandon the aggregative approach in favor of analyzing how different theories individually assess moral fragility, or (3) acknowledge that their conclusions hold only within specific theoretical frameworks rather than providing **general insights** about moral progress.

The paper **implicitly draws on threshold theories** of moral adequacy—the idea that certain moral minimums must be met for a future to count as genuinely eutopian. This philosophical foundation appears in Section 3.1's discussion of \"moral bottlenecks,\" where the authors argue that severe deficiencies in core areas like justice or welfare create **qualitative failures** that cannot be compensated by excellence elsewhere.\n\n## Alternative Interpretations Support Multiplicative Logic\n\nThe multiplicative approach captures something important that additive models miss: **moral prerequisites** for valuable futures. Consider analogous cases:\n\n* A society with perfect welfare distribution but systematic rights violations\n* A future with excellent individual flourishing but catastrophic environmental destruction\n* High aggregate utility achieved through morally abhorrent means\n\nIn each case, additive approaches might yield high overall scores despite fundamental moral failures. The multiplicative model better reflects the intuition that certain moral dimensions are **non-substitutable**.\n\n## The Critique Sets an Unreasonably High Bar\n\nDemanding \"fundamental reconceptualization\" overstates the problem. The paper's sensitivity analysis (Section 4.3) already shows that conclusions hold under various parameter specifications. More importantly, the authors explicitly acknowledge this as **one modeling choice among others** and invite further research using alternative aggregation functions.

This mathematical result lacks clear moral interpretation—it's neither a genuine threshold (which would involve discontinuous jumps) nor an obvious measure of **moral bottleneck severity**.\n\nThe paper never explains why smooth multiplicative decline better represents threshold phenomena than alternatives like:\n* **Lexicographic orderings** that prioritize the weakest moral dimension\n* **Step-function thresholds** with explicit adequacy cutoffs\n* **Weighted minimum functions** that focus on worst-performing areas\n* **Satisficing approaches** that distinguish adequate from inadequate performance\n\n## Insufficient Sensitivity Analysis\n\nThe claimed sensitivity analysis in Section 4.3 examines only **parameter variations within the multiplicative framework**—different weights and scaling factors for the same basic functional form. This leaves the core structural assumption untested against genuinely alternative aggregation methods. The analysis resembles testing different recipes for chocolate cake while never considering whether vanilla might be preferable.\n\nThis limitation has **profound implications for the paper's conclusions**. The pessimistic findings about eutopian achievability may reflect mathematical artifacts of multiplicative aggregation rather than robust insights about moral progress. Under lexicographic models, for instance, civilizations might achieve moral adequacy by ensuring no dimension falls below critical thresholds, potentially making moral progress far more achievable.\n\n## Missing Comparative Framework\n\nThe philosophical literature on **moral aggregation** provides extensive discussion of these alternatives. Anderson's work on democratic equality, Nussbaum's capabilities approach, and Rawls's lexical priority principles all suggest non-multiplicative approaches to combining moral considerations. The paper's failure to engage this literature or test its conclusions against these alternatives represents a significant methodological gap.\n\nMoreover, the paper's **threshold interpretation** sits uneasily with its continuous mathematics. Genuine threshold theories typically involve qualitative transitions—points where additional improvements in strong areas cannot compensate for failures in weak areas. Multiplicative functions, by contrast, always allow trade-offs, just at increasingly unfavorable rates.\n\n## What Successful Response Requires\n\nAddressing this critique demands **comprehensive comparative analysis**:\n* Direct modeling of identical moral scenarios using lexicographic, threshold-based, and satisficing approaches\n* Explicit justification for why continuous multiplicative functions better capture threshold intuitions than discrete alternatives\n* Analysis of whether pessimistic conclusions about moral fragility hold under plausible alternative aggregation methods\n* Engagement with philosophical literature on non-compensatory moral frameworks\n* Clear acknowledgment of how foundational mathematical choices shape substantive conclusions about civilizational risk\n\nWithout such analysis, the paper's sophisticated formal apparatus may rest on **arbitrary foundational assumptions** that predetermine its conclusions about moral progress and civilizational vulnerability.",

The overlapping consensus strategy—focusing on areas where different moral theories converge—represents a legitimate method for making progress on complex normative questions without requiring complete resolution of theoretical disagreements.\n\n## Implementation Exceeds Modest Claims\n\nHowever, the paper's **actual analytical practice** goes far beyond modest overlapping consensus. Section 5's risk calculations require numerical weighting and mathematical combination of assessments from fundamentally different moral frameworks—utilitarian welfare calculations, deontological rights assessments, and virtue-theoretic character evaluations. This isn't merely identifying shared concerns; it's performing **mathematical operations that assume commensurable value scales**.\n\nConsider the paper's treatment of rights violations versus welfare losses. The formal analysis requires assigning numerical values to both, then combining them through multiplicative aggregation. But rights theorists and utilitarians disagree not just about relative weights, but about whether such **quantitative comparison is conceptually coherent**. Rights theorists often insist that certain violations cannot be meaningfully traded off against welfare gains at any exchange rate.\n\n## The Conditional Analysis Dilemma\n\nThe suggested \"conditional analysis\" interpretation faces a **fundamental coherence problem**. If the paper's conclusions hold only within specific theoretical frameworks, then its claims about general moral fragility and civilizational risk become much weaker. The analysis cannot simultaneously claim broad relevance for long-term planning while retreating to framework-specific conditional conclusions.\n\nMoreover, the paper's **practical recommendations** in Section 6 clearly presuppose that its risk assessments have general validity across reasonable moral frameworks. The discussion of institutional safeguards and policy implications makes little sense if the underlying fragility analysis applies only within particular theoretical perspectives.\n\n## The Aggregation Literature Challenge\n\nExtensive work in **social choice theory** and moral philosophy demonstrates the deep difficulties in combining incommensurable values. Arrow's impossibility theorem, Sen's work on incomplete orderings, and Chang's analysis of incommensurability all suggest that the paper's pragmatic approach may be attempting the impossible. These aren't merely technical obstacles but reflect **fundamental conceptual problems** about the nature of moral value.\n\nThe paper's treatment of these challenges through \"pragmatic workarounds\" risks **methodological overconfidence**. By assuming that mathematical aggregation can proceed despite unresolved theoretical disagreements, the analysis may generate false precision about moral risk while obscuring the deep uncertainties that should inform policy decisions.\n\n## Required Methodological Transparency\n\nAddressing this critique requires **explicit methodological clarity** rather than theoretical breakthroughs:\n* Clear specification of which conclusions depend on intertheoretic aggregation versus representing intra-theoretical analysis\n* Separate presentation of results that hold within individual moral frameworks versus those requiring cross-theoretical combination\n* Direct acknowledgment of scope limitations imposed by pragmatic methodological choices\n* Analysis of whether the most practically important conclusions about civilizational moral risk survive without controversial aggregative assumptions\n* Explicit discussion of how unresolved meta-ethical disagreements affect the confidence intervals around key risk assessments\n\nThis approach would preserve the paper's valuable insights while avoiding **overconfident claims** about having resolved deep philosophical challenges through pragmatic methodology. The goal should be honest uncertainty quantification rather than false theoretical unity.",

The discussion of coordination mechanisms, institutional robustness considerations, and safeguards against moral failure demonstrates awareness that civilizational moral performance depends on more than aggregate individual judgment.\n\n## Analytical Architecture Creates Systematic Bias\n\nHowever, the paper's **analytical architecture** creates profound imbalance between individual and institutional factors. The core formal apparatus—probability distributions over individual moral failures, multiplicative aggregation of personal moral dimensions, quantitative fragility calculations—treats individual-level moral psychology as the primary driver of civilizational outcomes. Institutional factors receive largely qualitative discussion, creating **misleading analytical precision**.\n\nThis imbalance matters because it shapes the paper's **quantitative conclusions** about moral catastrophe risk. The mathematical models generate specific probability estimates for moral failure based on assumptions about individual moral judgment, cognitive limitations, and value drift. Meanwhile, institutional safeguards that might reduce these risks by orders of magnitude receive only conceptual treatment.\n\n## Institutional Robustness as Fundamental Variable\n\nConsider how robust institutional design might affect the paper's core calculations. **Constitutional protections**, independent judiciary systems, civil society organizations, and democratic accountability mechanisms could provide structural safeguards against the individual moral failures the paper identifies. A society with strong institutional checks might maintain moral adequacy even if significant portions of the population experience moral drift or cognitive failure.\n\nThe existing literature on **institutional design and moral progress** suggests these factors are not merely supplementary but potentially decisive. Work by Acemoglu and Robinson on inclusive institutions, Ostrom's analysis of collective action solutions, and historical studies of moral reform movements all indicate that institutional factors often **dominate individual-level variables** in determining large-scale moral outcomes.\n\n## Integration Rather Than Extension Required\n\nThe solution isn't relegating institutional analysis to \"future research\" but **methodological integration** within the current framework. The paper's sophisticated formal apparatus for analyzing individual moral fragility remains fundamentally incomplete without parallel treatment of institutional variables.\n\nSpecifically, the analysis needs:\n* **Quantitative modeling** of how institutional mechanisms affect the probability distributions used in fragility calculations\n* Systematic analysis of institutional failure modes that could undermine moral safeguards\n* Integration of institutional robustness measures into the central risk assessments rather than peripheral discussion\n* Explicit examination of how institutional factors might alter conclusions about eutopian achievability\n\n## Historical and Comparative Evidence\n\n**Historical analysis** supports the centrality of institutional factors. Major moral advances—abolition of slavery, expansion of democratic rights, development of international human rights frameworks—typically involved institutional transformation rather than simple aggregation of individual moral progress. Similarly, moral catastrophes often resulted from institutional breakdown rather than widespread individual moral failure.\n\nComparative analysis of contemporary societies shows **dramatic variation** in moral outcomes that correlates more strongly with institutional quality than with average individual moral judgment. Societies with similar populations but different institutional arrangements display vastly different performance on moral dimensions the paper considers central.\n\n## What Successful Response Requires\n\nAddressing this critique demands **architectural revision** rather than supplementary discussion:\n* Development of formal models for institutional robustness parallel to the existing individual-level analysis\n* Integration of institutional variables into the core probability calculations about moral fragility\n* Comparative analysis of how institutional versus individual factors affect the paper's key risk assessments\n* Explicit acknowledgment of how institutional considerations might fundamentally alter conclusions about civilizational moral vulnerability\n\nWithout such integration, the paper's sophisticated individual-level analysis may **systematically overestimate** civilizational moral risk by underweighting institutional solutions that provide structural protection against the moral failures it identifies.",
