## total-utilitarianism

**Id:** total-utilitarianism

**Name:** Total Utilitarianism

The best outcome is the one with the greatest total sum of wellbeing across all individuals. Creating new happy people adds value, and larger populations with positive lives are better than smaller ones.

Every unit of wellbeing matters equally, regardless of who experiences it or when they come into existence.

Total utilitarianism is the foundational view in population ethics and the primary target of Parfit's Repugnant Conclusion. Its theoretical elegance and consistency make it highly defensible, yet it generates deeply counterintuitive implications. It serves as the essential baseline against which all other views position themselves, and remains seriously defended by philosophers like Huemer and Tännsjö despite its challenges.

## critical-level-utilitarianism

**Id:** critical-level-utilitarianism

**Name:** Critical Level Utilitarianism

The best outcome maximizes the sum of wellbeing above a specified critical level (which is above zero). Creating a new person only adds value if their wellbeing exceeds this threshold, not merely if their life is worth living.

There is a meaningful difference between a life being worth living and a life being good enough to constitute a positive contribution to the world's value.

Developed by Charles Blackorby and colleagues, this view represents a sophisticated attempt to preserve aggregative consequentialist structure while avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion. It introduces genuine theoretical innovation but faces the 'Sadistic Conclusion' objection. It exemplifies how population ethics forces trade-offs between different counterintuitive results, making it ideal for exploring the impossibility theorems in the field.

## asymmetric-person-affecting-view

**Id:** asymmetric-person-affecting-view

**Name:** Asymmetric Person-Affecting View

While there is no moral reason to create happy people (since this benefits no one who otherwise would have existed), there is a strong moral reason not to create people who would suffer. The absence of suffering is good even if there is no one to enjoy that absence.

There is a fundamental asymmetry between pleasure and pain: failing to create happiness is not bad, but creating suffering is bad, even when the sufferer would not otherwise exist.

This view, associated with Benatar and refined by others, captures a powerful pre-theoretical intuition about the asymmetry of procreative reasons. It diverges radically from aggregative approaches by grounding ethics in harm-prevention rather than welfare-maximization. Its implications for antinatalism and its challenge to symmetrical treatment of pleasure and pain make it philosophically provocative and generate rich debate about the foundations of population ethics.
