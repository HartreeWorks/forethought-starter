  "reasoning": "The objection correctly identifies a structural feature of threshold-based theories, though the 'massive moral difference' framing somewhat overstates the case—the discontinuity in contribution value is real but the absolute magnitude at the threshold is infinitesimal. Critical-level utilitarians have standard responses: they can adopt fuzzy thresholds, argue the discontinuity is a feature not a bug (similar to other threshold concepts in ethics), or note that real-world wellbeing measurement lacks the precision to make such fine distinctions actionable. The damage is moderate because the view can function practically despite this theoretical wrinkle."
