  "reasoning": "The objection correctly identifies a genuine tension: setting the critical level high enough to avoid the Repugnant Conclusion risks implying that eliminating sub-threshold lives improves value, which does follow logically from the view's structure. The damage is substantial since CLU was explicitly designed to avoid counterintuitive conclusions, making this a self-defeating feature. However, defenders can argue that the critical level should be set at a moderate point where most actual lives exceed it, or invoke person-affecting constraints that block recommendations to eliminate existing people, though these responses require additional theoretical commitments."
