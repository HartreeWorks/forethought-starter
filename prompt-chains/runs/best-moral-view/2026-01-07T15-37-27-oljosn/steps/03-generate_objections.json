This follows necessarily from aggregating total wellbeing, yet the conclusion that we should prefer a world of countless people with lives barely worth living over a world of genuine human flourishing strikes most as deeply counterintuitive and morally repugnant.",

This means individuals who choose to remain childless, or societies that stabilize their populations, are acting wrongly—even if this choice allows them to provide better lives for existing people or pursue other valuable projects.

This means that killing someone and replacing them with an equally happy person (or two slightly less happy people whose combined wellbeing exceeds the original) would be morally permissible or even required. This 'replaceability' implication treats persons as mere vessels for wellbeing rather than as individuals with their own claims to continued existence, violating deep intuitions about the wrongness of killing.",

Total Utilitarianism thus either renders all our choices morally equivalent (since finite differences divided by infinity equal zero), or requires us to compare infinite quantities in ways that lead to paradoxes—such as being unable to say whether a world with infinite happiness plus one unit is better than one with infinite happiness alone.

Total Utilitarianism implies we should devote enormous resources to 'farming' such beings, since their aggregate mild contentment could exceed the total wellbeing of all humans pursuing rich, meaningful lives. This reduces morality to a kind of hedonic factory farming and suggests we should sacrifice the depth and variety of human experience for the mass production of simple positive states.",

If we must choose between adding one person at wellbeing -1 or adding a million people at wellbeing +5 (where the critical level is +10), the view counts the million people as contributing -5 million to total value, making the single suffering person preferable.

Any specific number seems unmotivated—why should the threshold be at wellbeing level 50 rather than 49 or 51? This arbitrariness undermines the theory's action-guiding capacity and suggests the distinction between 'worth living' and 'good enough to add value' may be a philosopher's invention rather than a genuine moral boundary.",

This means that slightly improving someone's life from 49.99 to 50.01 would swing their contribution from negative to positive—a massive moral difference from a trivial wellbeing change.

They are grateful to exist, would not prefer non-existence, and their life contains genuine goods. Yet Critical Level Utilitarianism says the world would be better if they had never existed—their very existence makes things worse.

A world with only a small elite of extremely flourishing individuals would be better than our current world with billions of people living decent but sub-threshold lives.

If we accept that non-existent beings cannot be benefited, it seems equally true that they cannot be harmed—yet the view treats these cases differently without adequate justification.

Even a person whose life would contain overwhelming happiness and minimal suffering still generates a moral reason against their creation (the suffering) with no countervailing moral reason for their creation (the happiness). This leads to the implausible conclusion that procreation is almost always morally problematic, effectively endorsing voluntary human extinction as the morally optimal outcome.",

The asymmetric view struggles to explain why conceiving now is wrong: Child A is not harmed by being created since they wouldn't otherwise exist, and the view denies that failing to create the happier Child B is bad.

If a child already exists and is suffering, we have strong reasons to help them experience pleasure instead. But if we could create that same child in identical circumstances, we have no reason to do so (creating pleasure has no moral weight) and only reasons against (they might suffer). This means the moral status of providing someone a wonderful life depends entirely on the metaphysically arbitrary fact of whether they already exist, making temporal location do implausible moral work.",
