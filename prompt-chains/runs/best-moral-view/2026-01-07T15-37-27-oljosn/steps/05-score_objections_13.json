  "reasoning": "The objection has merit but overstates the view's commitments—the asymmetric view typically holds that creating happy people is merely not obligatory, not that it has zero moral weight in all comparisons, and most versions don't treat suffering prevention as lexically prior to happiness. The damage is significant if the characterization holds, as it would make the view deeply counterintuitive, but defenders can distinguish between 'no positive duty to create' and 'creation has no value whatsoever.' Standard rebuttals involve clarifying that the asymmetry concerns obligations rather than absolute value rankings, though this requires careful articulation."
