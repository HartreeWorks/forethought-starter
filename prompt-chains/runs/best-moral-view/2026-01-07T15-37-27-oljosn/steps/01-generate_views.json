    "key_intuition": "Morality is fundamentally about benefiting and not harming actual individuals; we cannot have obligations to bring people into existence since non-existent beings cannot be benefited."

    "summary": "While there is no moral reason to create happy people (since this benefits no one who otherwise would have existed), there is a strong moral reason not to create people who would suffer. The absence of suffering is good even if there is no one to enjoy that absence.",
    "key_intuition": "There is a fundamental asymmetry between pleasure and pain: failing to create happiness is not bad, but creating suffering is bad, even when the sufferer would not otherwise exist."
