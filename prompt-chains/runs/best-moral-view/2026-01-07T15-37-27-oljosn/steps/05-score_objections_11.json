  "reasoning": "The objection correctly identifies that the asymmetry (suffering counts negatively but happiness doesn't count positively for non-existent beings) logically generates reasons against nearly all procreation. This is a strong logical derivation from the view's core commitments. However, proponents can respond by invoking threshold views, distinguishing between pro tanto reasons and all-things-considered judgments, or arguing that the reasons against are typically weak and easily overridden by other considerations (like parental autonomy or duties to existing persons). The damage is significant but not fatal since some defenders bite this bullet or modify the view to include comparative person-affecting considerations."
