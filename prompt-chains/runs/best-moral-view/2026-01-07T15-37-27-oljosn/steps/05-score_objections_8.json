  "reasoning": "The objection has genuine intuitive pull by highlighting a tension between first-personal gratitude and impersonal evaluation, but it conflates two distinct claims: whether a life is good for the person living it versus whether adding that life improves the world impersonally. CLU proponents can respond that the critical level precisely tracks what makes additions valuable, not what makes existing lives worth continuing—the person isn't wronged because no preference of theirs is frustrated and the evaluation is prospective, not retrospective. The objection has moderate force but relies on contestable assumptions about what 'wronging' requires and whether personal perspectives should constrain impersonal axiology."
