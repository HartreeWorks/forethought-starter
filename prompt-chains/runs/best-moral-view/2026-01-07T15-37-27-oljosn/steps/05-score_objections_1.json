  "reasoning": "The objection correctly identifies that total utilitarianism's aggregative structure implies strong procreative obligations, making the logical connection fairly tight. However, the damage is moderate because total utilitarians can bite this bullet or argue that resource constraints and diminishing returns naturally limit optimal population. Standard rebuttals involving satisficing versions, the distinction between positive and negative duties, or empirical claims about optimal population size provide workable responses, though each involves theoretical costs."
