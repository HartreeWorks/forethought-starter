  "reasoning": "The argument shows that the Asymmetric View aligns with common intuitions about procreative liberty, but this is primarily an appeal to intuition coherence rather than independent philosophical justification—the intuitions themselves may be mistaken or inconsistent. As a practical argument, it addresses application rather than the fundamental metaphysical or ethical questions at stake in population ethics. Critics can readily counter that many ethical views can be made consistent with procreative liberty through different framings, and that coherence with existing intuitions doesn't establish truth, especially when those intuitions may themselves reflect the asymmetry being defended (circularity concern)."
