- Total Utilitarianism embodies a profound commitment to moral impartiality: every unit of wellbeing counts equally regardless of who experiences it, when they exist, or whether they already exist or might come into being. This reflects the core moral insight that there is nothing special about any particular person's interests that makes them count more than anyone else's. Just as we reject discrimination based on race, gender, or nationality, we should reject arbitrary discrimination against future or merely possible persons whose lives would be genuinely worth living.
- Critical Level Utilitarianism faces a devastating arbitrariness problem: any critical level above zero seems impossible to justify non-arbitrarily. Why should a life with wellbeing of 50 count as adding value while a life at 49 does not, if both are genuinely worth living? Total Utilitarianism avoids this by using the only non-arbitrary threshold available—zero, the point at which a life becomes worth living at all. This makes the theory more principled and resistant to manipulation of the threshold for convenience.
- The Asymmetric Person-Affecting View claims there's no moral reason to create happy people but strong reasons not to create suffering ones. Yet this asymmetry leads to troubling implications: it suggests that a world with no sentient beings is morally optimal, and that we have no reason to ensure humanity's continuation even if future generations would flourish. Total Utilitarianism correctly recognizes that the existence of genuinely happy lives is a positive good, not merely morally neutral, capturing our intuition that a flourishing future matters.

- There is a meaningful moral distinction between a life being worth living for the person living it and a life being good enough to make the world better by its existence. A person with a minimally positive life—one just barely worth living—may not regret their existence, but it seems implausible that creating such a life constitutes a positive contribution to overall value. Critical Level Utilitarianism captures this intuition by requiring that new lives clear a meaningful bar before counting as improvements, reflecting our sense that merely non-negative existence is not the same as flourishing.
- Total Utilitarianism notoriously implies the Repugnant Conclusion: that a sufficiently large population of people with lives barely worth living is better than a smaller population of very happy people. Critical Level Utilitarianism avoids this by setting a threshold above zero—lives just barely worth living don't add positive value, so we cannot improve outcomes by replacing flourishing populations with vast numbers of minimally positive lives. This preserves the intuition that quality of life matters, not just aggregate quantity.
- Unlike the Asymmetric Person-Affecting View, which struggles to explain why we should create very happy people at all, Critical Level Utilitarianism maintains a coherent aggregative framework that still values the creation of genuinely flourishing lives. It preserves the appealing asymmetric intuition that barely-positive lives don't demand creation while avoiding the more radical conclusion that no amount of potential happiness provides reason for procreation. This offers a principled middle ground that respects both aggregative reasoning and threshold-based intuitions.

- Creating a happy person cannot benefit that person, since they would not exist otherwise to receive any benefit—there is no one for whom existence is better than non-existence. However, creating a suffering person does harm them, because once they exist, they experience genuine suffering that is bad for them. This asymmetry in the logic of benefit and harm provides a principled foundation for treating potential happiness and potential suffering differently in our moral calculations.
- Total Utilitarianism notoriously implies the Repugnant Conclusion: that a massive population of people with lives barely worth living is better than a smaller population with excellent lives. The Asymmetric View elegantly avoids this by denying that creating additional happy people adds moral value. Since there is no positive duty to create happiness, we cannot be morally required to expand population indefinitely, preserving our intuition that quality of life matters more than mere quantity.
- Suffering has a demanding, urgent quality that pleasure lacks—pain screams for relief in a way that the absence of pleasure does not cry out for satisfaction. This phenomenological asymmetry suggests that preventing suffering has a moral priority that promoting happiness does not share. The Asymmetric View captures this by treating the prevention of suffering as genuinely good (even for non-existent beings) while denying equivalent status to the creation of happiness.
