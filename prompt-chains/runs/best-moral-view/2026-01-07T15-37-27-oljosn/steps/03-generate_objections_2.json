    "name": "Unexplained Asymmetry",
    "objection": "The view posits a fundamental asymmetry between pleasure and pain but provides no principled explanation for why the absence of suffering is good when no one exists to benefit from that absence, while the absence of pleasure is not bad despite no one existing to be deprived. If we accept that non-existent beings cannot be benefited, it seems equally true that they cannot be harmed—yet the view treats these cases differently without adequate justification. This makes the asymmetry appear ad hoc rather than grounded in a coherent metaphysics of value.",

    "name": "The Procreative Paralysis Problem",
    "objection": "Since virtually every possible person will experience some suffering during their life, the view implies we have strong moral reasons against creating almost anyone. Even a person whose life would contain overwhelming happiness and minimal suffering still generates a moral reason against their creation (the suffering) with no countervailing moral reason for their creation (the happiness). This leads to the implausible conclusion that procreation is almost always morally problematic, effectively endorsing voluntary human extinction as the morally optimal outcome.",

    "name": "Non-Identity Problem Vulnerability",
    "objection": "Consider a couple who can either conceive now (creating child A with a minor disability) or wait three months (creating different child B who would be perfectly healthy). The asymmetric view struggles to explain why conceiving now is wrong: Child A is not harmed by being created since they wouldn't otherwise exist, and the view denies that failing to create the happier Child B is bad. The view's person-affecting component undermines its ability to guide choices between creating different possible people with different welfare levels.",

    "name": "The Sadistic Conclusion Reversal",
    "objection": "The view implies that a world with one billion supremely happy people is not better than an empty world (since creating happy people has no positive moral weight), but an empty world is better than a world with even one person experiencing mild, temporary suffering. This means we should prefer preventing the existence of a trillion flourishing lives containing trivial frustrations over allowing them to exist. The view thus generates its own form of sadistic conclusion by treating the prevention of any suffering as lexically prior to any amount of foregone happiness.",

    "name": "The Rescue vs. Creation Inconsistency",
    "objection": "The view creates a puzzling inconsistency between our obligations to existing and potential people. If a child already exists and is suffering, we have strong reasons to help them experience pleasure instead. But if we could create that same child in identical circumstances, we have no reason to do so (creating pleasure has no moral weight) and only reasons against (they might suffer). This means the moral status of providing someone a wonderful life depends entirely on the metaphysically arbitrary fact of whether they already exist, making temporal location do implausible moral work.",
