    "name": "The Non-Identity Benefit Problem",
    "argument": "Creating a happy person cannot benefit that person, since they would not exist otherwise to receive any benefit—there is no one for whom existence is better than non-existence. However, creating a suffering person does harm them, because once they exist, they experience genuine suffering that is bad for them. This asymmetry in the logic of benefit and harm provides a principled foundation for treating potential happiness and potential suffering differently in our moral calculations.",

    "name": "Avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion",
    "argument": "Total Utilitarianism notoriously implies the Repugnant Conclusion: that a massive population of people with lives barely worth living is better than a smaller population with excellent lives. The Asymmetric View elegantly avoids this by denying that creating additional happy people adds moral value. Since there is no positive duty to create happiness, we cannot be morally required to expand population indefinitely, preserving our intuition that quality of life matters more than mere quantity.",

    "name": "The Phenomenological Asymmetry of Suffering",
    "argument": "Suffering has a demanding, urgent quality that pleasure lacks—pain screams for relief in a way that the absence of pleasure does not cry out for satisfaction. This phenomenological asymmetry suggests that preventing suffering has a moral priority that promoting happiness does not share. The Asymmetric View captures this by treating the prevention of suffering as genuinely good (even for non-existent beings) while denying equivalent status to the creation of happiness.",

    "name": "Coherence with Procreative Liberty",
    "argument": "The Asymmetric View provides clear, sensible guidance for reproductive ethics: prospective parents have no obligation to create children for the sake of those children's happiness, but they do have strong reasons to avoid creating children who would suffer severely. This aligns with widely-held intuitions about procreative liberty—that choosing not to have children is morally permissible—while still grounding concerns about bringing children into circumstances of predictable misery.",

    "name": "The Absent Beneficiary Response",
    "argument": "Critics object that if the absence of suffering is good without a beneficiary, the absence of happiness should symmetrically be bad. But this misunderstands the view: the absence of suffering is good because suffering is intrinsically bad and its prevention removes something bad from the world, whereas the absence of happiness is merely neutral because there is no one who is deprived. The asymmetry lies not in arbitrary stipulation but in the different relationships between absence and the states themselves—preventing a bad differs fundamentally from failing to create a good.",
