**Force:** 72
**Damage:** 58
**Difficulty To Rebut:** 45
**Overall:** 58

## Instance 6
*Duration: 6.3s | Tokens: 685 in / 212 out*

**Id:** obj-critical-level-utilitarianism-01
**Target View:** critical-level-utilitarianism
**Name:** The Sadistic Conclusion
**Force:** 88
**Damage:** 82
**Difficulty To Rebut:** 75
**Overall:** 82
**Reasoning:** The logic follows directly from CLU's structure: any positive critical level mathematically entails that sufficiently many below-threshold positive lives count as worse than fewer negative lives. This...

**Force:** 72
**Damage:** 65
**Difficulty To Rebut:** 68
**Overall:** 68
**Reasoning:** The objection correctly identifies that CLU requires a precise threshold that seems difficult to justify non-arbitrarily, and this is a genuine structural concern. However, the force is somewhat mitig...

**Name:** The Discontinuity Paradox
**Force:** 72
**Damage:** 55
**Difficulty To Rebut:** 45

**Force:** 62
**Damage:** 58
**Difficulty To Rebut:** 55

**Name:** The Extinction Implication
**Force:** 72
**Damage:** 78
**Difficulty To Rebut:** 58
**Overall:** 69

**Name:** The Procreative Paralysis Problem
**Force:** 78
**Damage:** 75
**Difficulty To Rebut:** 65
**Overall:** 73
**Reasoning:** The objection correctly identifies that the asymmetry (suffering counts negatively but happiness doesn't count positively for non-existent beings) logically generates reasons against nearly all procre...

**Name:** The Sadistic Conclusion Reversal
**Force:** 62
**Damage:** 68
**Difficulty To Rebut:** 55
