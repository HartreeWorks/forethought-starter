  "reasoning": "The objection correctly identifies a genuine mathematical problem for aggregative consequentialism when dealing with infinite populations—this is a well-recognized issue in infinite ethics literature. However, the force is limited because the empirical premise (infinite future people) is uncertain, and several responses exist: discounting, using limit-based comparisons, or adopting alternative aggregation methods like overtaking criteria. The damage is significant since it threatens the view's action-guidance, but total utilitarians can restrict scope to finite horizons without obvious arbitrariness given our epistemic situation."
