  "reasoning": "This is a well-constructed variant of the Repugnant Conclusion that emphasizes the qualitative impoverishment of the maximally valuable outcome under total utilitarianism. The logical connection is strong—if welfare is fungible and aggregates matter, then mass-producing simple positive states could indeed dominate. However, total utilitarians have responses: they can argue that complex experiences contain more welfare than stipulated, invoke diminishing returns, or bite the bullet by claiming our intuitions against this are unreliable. The objection's force is somewhat reduced because it relies on contested assumptions about welfare comparability across radically different beings."
