  "reasoning": "The argument correctly identifies a genuine advantage of CLU over asymmetric person-affecting views in maintaining coherent aggregation, but overstates how 'principled' this middle ground is—critics argue the critical level is arbitrary and that CLU faces its own problems (like the Very Repugnant Conclusion for high thresholds). The comparative framing addresses an important structural question about population ethics, but the claim that CLU 'preserves' asymmetric intuitions is contestable since it still counts sub-threshold lives negatively rather than neutrally."
