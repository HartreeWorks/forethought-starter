  "reasoning": "The objection follows logically from total utilitarianism's core commitment to maximizing aggregate wellbeing without giving special weight to existing persons—the replaceability implication is a genuine structural consequence, not a misreading. The damage is substantial because it conflicts with deeply held moral intuitions about the wrongness of killing and personal inviolability, though some utilitarians bite this bullet. Rebuttals exist (indirect utilitarianism, rule-based approaches, arguing that actual killing always has negative side-effects) but these either modify the view significantly or seem ad hoc, making the objection moderately difficult to dismiss cleanly."
