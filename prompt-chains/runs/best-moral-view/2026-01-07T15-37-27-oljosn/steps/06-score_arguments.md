**Name:** Impartiality and Equal Moral Worth
**Force:** 58
**Importance:** 85
**Robustness:** 42
**Overall:** 62
**Reasoning:** The argument correctly identifies impartiality as a foundational moral commitment and draws a plausible analogy to anti-discrimination principles. However, it conflates equal moral worth of existing p...

## Instance 2
*Duration: 6.3s | Tokens: 646 in / 236 out*

**Id:** arg-total-utilitarianism-02
**Supports View:** total-utilitarianism
**Name:** Avoiding Arbitrary Thresholds
**Force:** 62
**Importance:** 58
**Robustness:** 45
**Overall:** 55
**Reasoning:** The argument correctly identifies a genuine problem for Critical Level Utilitarianism, but its claim that zero is uniquely non-arbitrary is contestable—the zero point itself requires a theory of what ...

## Instance 3
*Duration: 6.1s | Tokens: 669 in / 228 out*

**Id:** arg-total-utilitarianism-03

**Name:** Rejecting the Asymmetry's Hidden Costs
**Force:** 58
**Importance:** 75
**Robustness:** 45
**Overall:** 59
**Reasoning:** The argument correctly identifies genuine tensions in asymmetric views, particularly regarding extinction and empty worlds, which are real costs that asymmetry proponents must address. However, the fo...

## Instance 4
*Duration: 6.3s | Tokens: 643 in / 230 out*

**Id:** arg-total-utilitarianism-04
**Supports View:** total-utilitarianism
**Name:** Clear Guidance for Existential Risk Policy
**Force:** 45
**Importance:** 55
**Robustness:** 35
**Overall:** 45
**Reasoning:** The argument overstates Total Utilitarianism's uniqueness—other views (person-affecting with caveats, contractualism, virtue ethics) can also justify existential risk mitigation without the same theor...

## Instance 5
*Duration: 6.9s | Tokens: 659 in / 237 out*

**Id:** arg-total-utilitarianism-05
**Supports View:** total-utilitarianism
**Name:** The Repugnant Conclusion as Moral Progress
**Force:** 45
**Importance:** 85
**Robustness:** 35
**Overall:** 55
**Reasoning:** The argument makes a legitimate point about cognitive limitations regarding large numbers and the historical unreliability of moral intuitions, but it's largely speculative about which intuitions are ...

---

## Instance 6
*Duration: 9.4s | Tokens: 655 in / 215 out*

**Id:** arg-critical-level-utilitarianism-01
**Supports View:** critical-level-utilitarianism
**Name:** The Contribution Threshold Intuition
**Force:** 58
**Importance:** 85
**Robustness:** 42
**Overall:** 62
**Reasoning:** The argument articulates a genuine and widely-shared intuition that distinguishes personal worth-living from impersonal contribution to value, which is philosophically substantive and central to motiv...

---

## Instance 7
*Duration: 14.5s | Tokens: 653 in / 218 out*

**Id:** arg-critical-level-utilitarianism-02
**Supports View:** critical-level-utilitarianism
**Name:** Avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion
**Force:** 72
**Importance:** 88
**Robustness:** 45
**Overall:** 68
**Reasoning:** The argument correctly identifies a major motivation for CLU—avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion is central to population ethics debates and the reasoning is logically sound. However, robustness suffers...

---

## Instance 8
*Duration: 19.3s | Tokens: 660 in / 224 out*

**Id:** arg-critical-level-utilitarianism-03
**Supports View:** critical-level-utilitarianism
**Name:** Coherent Aggregation Despite Asymmetry
**Force:** 58
**Importance:** 72
**Robustness:** 45
**Overall:** 58
**Reasoning:** The argument correctly identifies a genuine advantage of CLU over asymmetric person-affecting views in maintaining coherent aggregation, but overstates how 'principled' this middle ground is—critics a...

---

## Instance 9
*Duration: 6.0s | Tokens: 663 in / 234 out*

**Id:** arg-critical-level-utilitarianism-04
**Supports View:** critical-level-utilitarianism
**Name:** The Sadistic Conclusion Objection is Manageable
**Force:** 42
**Importance:** 85
**Robustness:** 35
**Overall:** 54
**Reasoning:** The argument correctly identifies that the Sadistic Conclusion is a major objection requiring response, and the tu quoque against Total Utilitarianism has some merit. However, the defense is weak: cla...

## Instance 10
*Duration: 10.0s | Tokens: 639 in / 222 out*

**Id:** arg-critical-level-utilitarianism-05
**Supports View:** critical-level-utilitarianism
**Name:** Sensible Guidance for Population Policy
**Force:** 45
**Importance:** 50
**Robustness:** 35
**Overall:** 43
**Reasoning:** The argument appeals to practical alignment with policy intuitions, but this is philosophically weak—matching intuitions doesn't establish theoretical correctness, and total utilitarianism could also ...

---

**Name:** The Non-Identity Benefit Problem
**Force:** 55
**Importance:** 90
**Robustness:** 40
**Overall:** 62
**Reasoning:** The argument addresses the central challenge for asymmetric views—providing a principled basis for treating potential happiness and suffering differently—making it highly important. However, the reaso...

**Name:** Avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion
**Force:** 65
**Importance:** 85
**Robustness:** 45
**Overall:** 65
**Reasoning:** The argument correctly identifies that the Asymmetric View avoids the Repugnant Conclusion, which is a major theoretical advantage and addresses a central problem in population ethics. However, the re...

**Id:** arg-asymmetric-person-affecting-view-03
**Supports View:** asymmetric-person-affecting-view
**Name:** The Phenomenological Asymmetry of Suffering
**Force:** 55
**Importance:** 75
**Robustness:** 40
**Overall:** 57
**Reasoning:** The argument appeals to a genuine phenomenological observation about the urgency of suffering, but the inference from descriptive phenomenology to normative asymmetry is contestable—intensity of exper...

## Instance 14
*Duration: 6.3s | Tokens: 640 in / 237 out*

**Id:** arg-asymmetric-person-affecting-view-04
**Supports View:** asymmetric-person-affecting-view
**Name:** Coherence with Procreative Liberty
**Force:** 52
**Importance:** 45
**Robustness:** 40
**Overall:** 46
**Reasoning:** The argument shows that the Asymmetric View aligns with common intuitions about procreative liberty, but this is primarily an appeal to intuition coherence rather than independent philosophical justif...

**Name:** The Absent Beneficiary Response
**Force:** 45
**Importance:** 85
**Robustness:** 35
**Overall:** 55
**Reasoning:** The argument addresses a central symmetry objection but its core move—claiming preventing bad differs fundamentally from failing to create good—largely restates the asymmetry rather than justifying it...
