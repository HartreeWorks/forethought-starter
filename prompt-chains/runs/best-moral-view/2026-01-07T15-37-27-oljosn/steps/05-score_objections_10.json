  "reasoning": "The objection correctly identifies a structural tension: if non-existent beings cannot be benefited or harmed, treating the absence of pain as good while the absence of pleasure is not bad requires justification beyond mere stipulation. The damage is substantial since the asymmetry is foundational to the view, not peripheral. However, defenders have responses—appealing to phenomenological asymmetries between pleasure and pain, or arguing the asymmetry tracks common moral intuitions about procreation—though these rebuttals remain contested and may appear to simply relocate rather than resolve the explanatory burden."
