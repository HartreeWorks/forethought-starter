## total-utilitarianism

**Id:** total-utilitarianism

**Name:** Total Utilitarianism

The best outcome is the one with the greatest total sum of wellbeing across all individuals. Creating new happy people adds value, and larger populations with positive lives are better than smaller ones.

Every unit of wellbeing matters equally, regardless of who experiences it or when they come into existence.

## average-utilitarianism

**Id:** average-utilitarianism

**Name:** Average Utilitarianism

The best outcome is the one with the highest average level of wellbeing per person. Population size itself has no intrinsic value; what matters is how well off people are on average.

Adding people with lives worth living but below the current average makes things worse, as it dilutes the quality of existence.

## critical-level-utilitarianism

**Id:** critical-level-utilitarianism

**Name:** Critical Level Utilitarianism

The best outcome maximizes the sum of wellbeing above a specified critical level (which is above zero). Creating a new person only adds value if their wellbeing exceeds this threshold, not merely if their life is worth living.

There is a meaningful difference between a life being worth living and a life being good enough to constitute a positive contribution to the world's value.

## person-affecting-necessitarianism

**Id:** person-affecting-necessitarianism

**Name:** Person-Affecting Necessitarianism

An outcome can only be better or worse than another if it is better or worse for someone who exists in both outcomes. Merely possible people generate no moral reasons, so creating happy people has no intrinsic value.

Morality is fundamentally about benefiting and not harming actual individuals; we cannot have obligations to bring people into existence since non-existent beings cannot be benefited.

## asymmetric-person-affecting-view

**Id:** asymmetric-person-affecting-view

**Name:** Asymmetric Person-Affecting View

While there is no moral reason to create happy people (since this benefits no one who otherwise would have existed), there is a strong moral reason not to create people who would suffer. The absence of suffering is good even if there is no one to enjoy that absence.

There is a fundamental asymmetry between pleasure and pain: failing to create happiness is not bad, but creating suffering is bad, even when the sufferer would not otherwise exist.
