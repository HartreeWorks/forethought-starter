  "reasoning": "The argument correctly identifies a major motivation for CLU—avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion is central to population ethics debates and the reasoning is logically sound. However, robustness suffers significantly because CLU faces its own well-known problems: it implies the 'Very Repugnant Conclusion' (preferring hellish additions to avoid sub-critical positive lives) and struggles to non-arbitrarily justify any particular critical level. The comparative advantage over Total Utilitarianism is real but comes with substantial theoretical costs."
