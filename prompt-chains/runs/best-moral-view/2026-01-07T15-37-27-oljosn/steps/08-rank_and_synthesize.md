# Rank And Synthesize

## Ranked Views


## Item 1

**Rank:** 1

**View Id:** critical-level-utilitarianism

**View Name:** Critical Level Utilitarianism

**Defensibility Score:** 42

Despite sharing the same defensibility score as the other views, CLU edges ahead due to its higher argument support score (62 vs 52-61). The view's structural innovation—maintaining aggregative reasoning while introducing asymmetric-like features—represents a genuine theoretical advance. While the Sadistic Conclusion is deeply troubling, CLU retains more flexibility for theoretical refinement (e.g., variable thresholds, context-sensitivity) than its competitors. Its problems, though severe, appear more amenable to modification than the foundational issues facing the other views.

## Item 2

**Rank:** 2

**View Id:** asymmetric-person-affecting-view

**View Name:** Asymmetric Person-Affecting View

**Defensibility Score:** 42

The Asymmetric View ranks second due to its lower objection damage (74 vs 78) and strong intuitive appeal regarding the moral urgency of preventing suffering. While the unexplained asymmetry remains a significant theoretical burden, the view captures something important about our moral psychology—we do seem to treat the prevention of suffering as more urgent than the creation of happiness. However, the Non-Identity Problem and Procreative Paralysis concerns significantly limit its practical applicability, preventing it from claiming the top position.

## Item 3

**Rank:** 3

**View Id:** total-utilitarianism

**View Name:** Total Utilitarianism

**Defensibility Score:** 42

Total Utilitarianism ranks last despite its theoretical elegance and simplicity. The Repugnant Conclusion, after decades of philosophical scrutiny, remains unresolved and follows necessarily from the view's core commitments. The combination of high objection damage (78), lowest argument support (52), and the particularly troubling nature of its implications—including replaceability and welfare farming concerns—make the required 'bullet-biting' more demanding than for competing views. The view's problems stem from its foundational structure rather than peripheral features, making modification difficult without abandoning its distinctive character.

## Synthesis

This analysis reveals a striking convergence in defensibility among the three major approaches to population ethics, with all views receiving identical scores of 42. This result is itself philosophically significant: it suggests that population ethics remains a domain where no existing theory has achieved clear superiority, and where choosing among views requires weighing incommensurable theoretical virtues against different sets of counterintuitive implications. The marginal differences that determined the final ranking—CLU's greater argument support, the Asymmetric View's lower objection damage, and Total Utilitarianism's more fundamental structural problems—reflect genuine but modest distinctions in overall defensibility.

Perhaps the most surprising finding is Total Utilitarianism's last-place finish despite being the most theoretically simple and historically influential view. The analysis reveals that simplicity and elegance provide insufficient protection against severe counterintuitive implications. The Repugnant Conclusion's persistence as an unsolved problem after decades of philosophical attention suggests it may represent a genuine reductio rather than a mere intuition to be revised. Conversely, Critical Level Utilitarianism performed better than might be expected given the severity of the Sadistic Conclusion, largely because its framework offers more resources for theoretical modification and refinement.

The analysis illuminates a fundamental tension in population ethics between avoiding counterintuitive conclusions and maintaining theoretical coherence. Total Utilitarianism achieves coherence at the cost of the Repugnant Conclusion; CLU avoids that conclusion but generates the arguably worse Sadistic Conclusion; the Asymmetric View avoids both but struggles to explain its foundational asymmetry and faces the Non-Identity Problem. This suggests that population ethics may require either accepting some deeply counterintuitive implications, embracing theoretical complexity that resists simple formulation, or reconceptualizing the problem space entirely. The convergent defensibility scores indicate we may be at an impasse requiring new theoretical frameworks rather than refinements of existing approaches.

The state of population ethics revealed here is one of genuine theoretical difficulty rather than mere disagreement. Each view captures important moral intuitions while generating serious problems, and the analysis suggests these tradeoffs may be structural features of the problem space rather than contingent failures of existing theories. The field appears to need either breakthrough innovations in how we think about potential persons and their moral status, or a more explicit methodology for adjudicating between different types of theoretical costs.

## Uncertainties


## Item 1

The scoring methodology may not adequately capture qualitative differences between types of objections—a single devastating objection might be worse than multiple moderate ones, but this isn't fully reflected in aggregated scores.

## Item 2

The analysis focused on three prominent views but omitted other serious contenders (Average Utilitarianism, Variable Value approaches, Necessitarianism) that might perform better under similar scrutiny.

## Item 3

Defensibility scores are sensitive to which objections and arguments are included; different selections could yield different rankings.

## Item 4

The analysis may underweight practical applicability—a view that provides clearer action-guidance might be preferable even with lower theoretical defensibility.

## Item 5

Intuition-based objections (like the Repugnant Conclusion) may reflect cognitive biases rather than genuine moral insight, but the analysis treats them as significant evidence.

## Item 6

The relative severity of different counterintuitive conclusions (Repugnant vs. Sadistic vs. Procreative Paralysis) involves contested value judgments that reasonable people may weigh differently.

## Recommendations


## Item 1

Investigate hybrid approaches that combine elements of multiple views—for instance, person-affecting constraints on aggregative frameworks, or context-sensitive critical levels that vary with population characteristics.

## Item 2

Develop more rigorous methods for distinguishing intuitions that track genuine moral truths from those reflecting cognitive limitations or evolutionary biases.

## Item 3

Explore whether the Non-Identity Problem admits of solutions that could rehabilitate person-affecting approaches without abandoning their core insights.

## Item 4

Examine whether population ethics problems might be partially dissolved by reconceptualizing personal identity, welfare, or the metaphysics of potential persons.

## Item 5

Conduct empirical research on how different population ethical views perform in practical policy contexts, as theoretical defensibility may not track decision-guidance quality.

## Item 6

Investigate whether formal impossibility results (analogous to Arrow's theorem) constrain what any adequate population ethics can achieve, which would reframe the debate around which impossibility to accept.
