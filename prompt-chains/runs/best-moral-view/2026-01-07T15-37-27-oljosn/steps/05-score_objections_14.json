  "reasoning": "The objection effectively highlights a genuine asymmetry in the view's treatment of pleasure for existing vs. potential persons, and the framing around 'metaphysically arbitrary' temporal location is rhetorically potent. However, proponents can argue this asymmetry is precisely what the view endorses—existence is morally relevant because only existing persons have welfare that can be affected—making the 'arbitrariness' charge contestable rather than decisive. The objection has moderate force but doesn't clearly show the view is incoherent, as asymmetric views are designed to treat existence as morally significant."
