            "assessment_summary": "Critical Level Utilitarianism occupies an uncomfortable middle ground in population ethics. Its primary motivation—avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion that plagues Total Utilitarianism—is compelling and represents a genuine theoretical advance. The view also captures an important intuition that there is a meaningful distinction between a life being worth living for the individual and a life being valuable enough to constitute a positive contribution to overall value. These considerations provide moderate support, and the view's ability to maintain coherent aggregation while introducing asymmetric-like features is a structural advantage over pure person-affecting approaches.\n\nHowever, CLU faces devastating objections that significantly undermine its defensibility. The Sadistic Conclusion—that CLU can prefer outcomes with suffering people over outcomes with many people living good (but sub-threshold) lives—is arguably worse than the Repugnant Conclusion it was designed to avoid. This represents a fundamental structural problem, not a peripheral concern. The Arbitrary Threshold Problem compounds this difficulty: any specific critical level seems difficult to justify non-arbitrarily, and different threshold choices generate different problematic implications. The Extinction Implication further suggests that high critical levels could make human extinction look acceptable or even desirable if most lives fall below threshold.\n\nThe cumulative damage from these objections is severe. While CLU's supporting arguments are substantive, they largely establish the view's motivation rather than providing resources to respond to its distinctive problems. The view appears to trade one set of counterintuitive implications for another arguably worse set, without clear guidance on how to set the critical level to minimize these costs. CLU remains a serious contender in population ethics due to its structural innovations, but its current formulation faces challenges that significantly limit its defensibility as a complete theory."

            "assessment_summary": "The Asymmetric Person-Affecting View faces a formidable trio of objections that collectively threaten its coherence and applicability. The Non-Identity Problem Vulnerability (scored 76) is particularly damaging because it undermines the view's ability to guide reproductive ethics—a domain where the view should have natural application. If the view cannot explain why it's wrong to make choices that predictably lead to worse-off individuals when those individuals wouldn't exist under alternative choices, it loses significant practical relevance. The Procreative Paralysis Problem (73) compounds this by suggesting the view generates reasons against virtually all procreation, which either requires biting a significant bullet or abandoning the view's core commitments. The Unexplained Asymmetry objection (72) strikes at the foundational level, questioning why the absence of suffering is good but the absence of pleasure is not bad—a challenge that defenders have not fully resolved despite various attempts.\n\nThe supporting arguments provide meaningful but insufficient counterweight. Avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion (65) is a genuine theoretical advantage, as this is one of population ethics' most troubling puzzles, but other views also avoid it without the asymmetry's costs. The Non-Identity Benefit Problem argument (62) attempts to justify the asymmetry by appealing to the impossibility of benefiting non-existent beings, but this reasoning is vulnerable to the charge that it should apply symmetrically to harm as well. The Phenomenological Asymmetry of Suffering (57) appeals to intuitive considerations about the urgency of suffering, but the inference from phenomenology to normative priority remains contested.\n\nOverall, the Asymmetric Person-Affecting View occupies a challenging position in population ethics. While it successfully avoids some of the most troubling implications of aggregative theories, it does so at the cost of internal coherence and practical applicability. The cumulative damage from the three major objections (averaging around 74) outweighs the support from its strongest arguments (averaging around 61), leaving the view with a defensibility score of 42. The view may appeal to those who find the asymmetry between creating suffering and failing to create happiness deeply intuitive, but it requires either accepting significant theoretical costs or supplementing the view with additional principles that may compromise its distinctive character."

          "assessment_summary": "The Asymmetric Person-Affecting View faces a formidable trio of objections that collectively threaten its coherence and applicability. The Non-Identity Problem Vulnerability (scored 76) is particularly damaging because it undermines the view's ability to guide reproductive ethics—a domain where the view should have natural application. If the view cannot explain why it's wrong to make choices that predictably lead to worse-off individuals when those individuals wouldn't exist under alternative choices, it loses significant practical relevance. The Procreative Paralysis Problem (73) compounds this by suggesting the view generates reasons against virtually all procreation, which either requires biting a significant bullet or abandoning the view's core commitments. The Unexplained Asymmetry objection (72) strikes at the foundational level, questioning why the absence of suffering is good but the absence of pleasure is not bad—a challenge that defenders have not fully resolved despite various attempts.\n\nThe supporting arguments provide meaningful but insufficient counterweight. Avoiding the Repugnant Conclusion (65) is a genuine theoretical advantage, as this is one of population ethics' most troubling puzzles, but other views also avoid it without the asymmetry's costs. The Non-Identity Benefit Problem argument (62) attempts to justify the asymmetry by appealing to the impossibility of benefiting non-existent beings, but this reasoning is vulnerable to the charge that it should apply symmetrically to harm as well. The Phenomenological Asymmetry of Suffering (57) appeals to intuitive considerations about the urgency of suffering, but the inference from phenomenology to normative priority remains contested.\n\nOverall, the Asymmetric Person-Affecting View occupies a challenging position in population ethics. While it successfully avoids some of the most troubling implications of aggregative theories, it does so at the cost of internal coherence and practical applicability. The cumulative damage from the three major objections (averaging around 74) outweighs the support from its strongest arguments (averaging around 61), leaving the view with a defensibility score of 42. The view may appeal to those who find the asymmetry between creating suffering and failing to create happiness deeply intuitive, but it requires either accepting significant theoretical costs or supplementing the view with additional principles that may compromise its distinctive character."

This result is itself philosophically significant: it suggests that population ethics remains a domain where no existing theory has achieved clear superiority, and where choosing among views requires weighing incommensurable theoretical virtues against different sets of counterintuitive implications. The marginal differences that determined the final ranking—CLU's greater argument support, the Asymmetric View's lower objection damage, and Total Utilitarianism's more fundamental structural problems—reflect genuine but modest distinctions in overall defensibility.\n\nPerhaps the most surprising finding is Total Utilitarianism's last-place finish despite being the most theoretically simple and historically influential view. The analysis reveals that simplicity and elegance provide insufficient protection against severe counterintuitive implications. The Repugnant Conclusion's persistence as an unsolved problem after decades of philosophical attention suggests it may represent a genuine reductio rather than a mere intuition to be revised. Conversely, Critical Level Utilitarianism performed better than might be expected given the severity of the Sadistic Conclusion, largely because its framework offers more resources for theoretical modification and refinement.\n\nThe analysis illuminates a fundamental tension in population ethics between avoiding counterintuitive conclusions and maintaining theoretical coherence. Total Utilitarianism achieves coherence at the cost of the Repugnant Conclusion; CLU avoids that conclusion but generates the arguably worse Sadistic Conclusion; the Asymmetric View avoids both but struggles to explain its foundational asymmetry and faces the Non-Identity Problem. This suggests that population ethics may require either accepting some deeply counterintuitive implications, embracing theoretical complexity that resists simple formulation, or reconceptualizing the problem space entirely. The convergent defensibility scores indicate we may be at an impasse requiring new theoretical frameworks rather than refinements of existing approaches.\n\nThe state of population ethics revealed here is one of genuine theoretical difficulty rather than mere disagreement. Each view captures important moral intuitions while generating serious problems, and the analysis suggests these tradeoffs may be structural features of the problem space rather than contingent failures of existing theories.
