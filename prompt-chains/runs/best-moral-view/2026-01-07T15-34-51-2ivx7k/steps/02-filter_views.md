## totalism

**Id:** totalism

**Name:** Total Utilitarianism

The best outcome is the one that maximizes the total sum of well-being across all individuals who ever exist.

**Key Intuition:** More happiness is always better, regardless of how it's distributed across people or time.

The most influential classical view in population ethics, taken seriously since Sidgwick. Generates the Repugnant Conclusion but has sophisticated defenses. Essential baseline for the field.

## averagism

**Id:** averagism

**Name:** Average Utilitarianism

**Summary:** The best outcome maximizes the average level of well-being per person rather than the total.

**Key Intuition:** What matters is how well lives go on average, not simply adding more people with positive lives.

Major historical alternative to totalism. Avoids Repugnant Conclusion but faces the Mere Addition Paradox and counterintuitive implications about small populations. Represents person-affecting intuitions.

## critical-level

**Id:** critical-level

**Name:** Critical Level Utilitarianism

Adding a person improves an outcome only if their well-being exceeds a positive critical threshold, not merely zero.

A life must be sufficiently good—not just barely worth living—to constitute a genuine addition to the world's value.

Sophisticated compromise position developed by Blackorby, Bossert, and Donaldson. Addresses Repugnant Conclusion while maintaining aggregative structure. Highly influential in welfare economics.

## person-affecting

**Id:** person-affecting

**Name:** Person-Affecting View (Narrow)

An outcome can only be better or worse if it is better or worse for some particular individual. Creating new happy people doesn't make things better.

Ethics is fundamentally about how our actions affect identifiable individuals, not about bringing value-containers into existence.

Represents a fundamentally different approach that denies the core assumption of impersonal value. Defended by Narveson, Roberts, and others. Faces Non-Identity Problem but captures strong moral intuitions.

## variable-value

**Id:** variable-value

**Name:** Variable Value View

The marginal value of additional well-being diminishes as population size increases, making large populations of mediocre lives less valuable than totalism implies.

There are diminishing returns to adding more people; the first billion happy lives matter more than the trillionth billion.

Developed by Hurka and Ng as a nuanced middle position. Avoids Repugnant Conclusion while maintaining that population matters. Represents important class of non-linear aggregation theories.
