    "summary": "The best outcome is the one that maximizes the total sum of well-being across all individuals who ever exist.",
    "key_intuition": "More happiness is always better, regardless of how it's distributed across people or time.",
    "selection_reason": "The most influential classical view in population ethics, taken seriously since Sidgwick. Generates the Repugnant Conclusion but has sophisticated defenses. Essential baseline for the field."

    "id": "averagism",
    "name": "Average Utilitarianism",
    "summary": "The best outcome maximizes the average level of well-being per person rather than the total.",
    "key_intuition": "What matters is how well lives go on average, not simply adding more people with positive lives.",
    "selection_reason": "Major historical alternative to totalism. Avoids Repugnant Conclusion but faces the Mere Addition Paradox and counterintuitive implications about small populations. Represents person-affecting intuitions."

    "id": "critical-level",
    "name": "Critical Level Utilitarianism",
    "summary": "Adding a person improves an outcome only if their well-being exceeds a positive critical threshold, not merely zero.",
    "key_intuition": "A life must be sufficiently good—not just barely worth living—to constitute a genuine addition to the world's value.",
    "selection_reason": "Sophisticated compromise position developed by Blackorby, Bossert, and Donaldson. Addresses Repugnant Conclusion while maintaining aggregative structure. Highly influential in welfare economics."

    "id": "person-affecting",
    "name": "Person-Affecting View (Narrow)",
    "summary": "An outcome can only be better or worse if it is better or worse for some particular individual. Creating new happy people doesn't make things better.",
    "key_intuition": "Ethics is fundamentally about how our actions affect identifiable individuals, not about bringing value-containers into existence.",
    "selection_reason": "Represents a fundamentally different approach that denies the core assumption of impersonal value. Defended by Narveson, Roberts, and others. Faces Non-Identity Problem but captures strong moral intuitions."

  {
    "id": "variable-value",
    "name": "Variable Value View",
    "summary": "The marginal value of additional well-being diminishes as population size increases, making large populations of mediocre lives less valuable than totalism implies.",
    "key_intuition": "There are diminishing returns to adding more people; the first billion happy lives matter more than the trillionth billion.",
    "selection_reason": "Developed by Hurka and Ng as a nuanced middle position. Avoids Repugnant Conclusion while maintaining that population matters. Represents important class of non-linear aggregation theories."
